COURTESAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
  I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
  Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
COURTESAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
  Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.
COURTESAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
  Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,
  And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
COURTESAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;
  I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
COURTESAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
  Else would he never so demean himself.
  A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
  And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
  Both one and other he denies me now.
  The reason that I gather he is mad,
  Besides this present instance of his rage,
  Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
  Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
  Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
  On purpose shut the doors against his way.
  My way is now to hie home to his house,
  And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
  He rush'd into my house and took perforce
  My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
  For forty ducats is too much to lose.

SCENE 4
A street
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER
COURTESAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
COURTESAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
COURTESAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day
  Came to my house, and took away my ring-
  The ring I saw upon his finger now-
  Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
COURTESAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
COURTESAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
COURTESAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

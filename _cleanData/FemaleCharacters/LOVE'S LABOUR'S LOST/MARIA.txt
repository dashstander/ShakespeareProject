  MARIA. I know him, madam; at a marriage feast,
    Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
    Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
    In Normandy, saw I this Longaville.
    A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
    Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms;
    Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
    The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
    If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
    Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will,
    Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
    It should none spare that come within his power.
  MARIA. They say so most that most his humours know.
  MARIA. That last is Berowne, the merry mad-cap lord;
    Not a word with him but a jest.
  MARIA. Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.  
  MARIA. No.
  MARIA. Ay, our way to be gone.
  MARIA. You Still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the
    brow.
  MARIA. A mark marvellous well shot; for they both did hit it.
  MARIA. Wide o' the bow-hand! I' faith, your hand is out.
  MARIA. Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.  
  MARIA. This, and these pearl, to me sent Longaville;
    The letter is too long by half a mile.  
  MARIA. Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
  MARIA. Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote,
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
                          Enter BOYET
  MARIA. Name it.
  MARIA. Say you so? Fair lord-
    Take that for your fair lady.
  MARIA. Dumain was at my service, and his sword.
    'No point' quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
  MARIA. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
  MARIA. At the twelvemonth's end
    I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
  MARIA. The liker you; few taller are so young.

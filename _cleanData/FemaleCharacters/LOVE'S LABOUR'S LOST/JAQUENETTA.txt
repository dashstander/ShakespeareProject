  JAQUENETTA. Man!
  JAQUENETTA. That's hereby.
  JAQUENETTA. Lord, how wise you are!  
  JAQUENETTA. With that face?
  JAQUENETTA. So I heard you say.
  JAQUENETTA. Fair weather after you!
  JAQUENETTA. God give you good morrow, Master Person.
  JAQUENETTA. Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter;
    it was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I
    beseech you read it.
  JAQUENETTA. Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange
    queen's lords.
  JAQUENETTA. Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
  JAQUENETTA. God bless the King!
  JAQUENETTA. I beseech your Grace, let this letter be read;
    Our person misdoubts it: 'twas treason, he said.
  JAQUENETTA. Of Costard.

  CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
    most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
    to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
    charge his horns with garlands!
  CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
  CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.
  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.
  CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.
  CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!
  CHARMIAN. Hush!
  CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
  CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
    three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
  CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
  CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.
    Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?  
  CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
  CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
  CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
    cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
  CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
    where would you choose it?
  CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
    fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
    sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
    worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
    him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
    me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
    Isis, I beseech thee!
  CHARMIAN. Amen.
  CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.
  CHARMIAN. No, madam.
  CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.
  CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
    You do not hold the method to enforce
    The like from him.
  CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
    In time we hate that which we often fear.
                            Enter ANTONY
  
    But here comes Antony.
  CHARMIAN. Madam?
  CHARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
    I sing but after you.
  CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  CHARMIAN. 'Twas merry when
    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
    Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
    With fervency drew up.
  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
    The man is innocent.
  CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
  CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.
  CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt
    Cannot make better note.  
  CHARMIAN. Excellent.
  CHARMIAN. A proper man.
  CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.
  CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
    And serving you so long!
  CHARMIAN. I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt
ACT_3|SC_4
                          SCENE IV.
                  Athens. ANTONY'S house
                 Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA
  CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?
  CHARMIAN. Madam!  
  CHARMIAN. Please you retire to your chamber?
  CHARMIAN. To th'monument!
    There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
    The soul and body rive not more in parting
    Than greatness going off.
  CHARMIAN. Be comforted, dear madam.
  CHARMIAN. O, quietness, lady!
  CHARMIAN. Lady!
  CHARMIAN. O madam, madam, madam!
  CHARMIAN. Peace, peace, Iras!
  CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!
  CHARMIAN. Madam, I will.
                      Re-enter DOLABELLA
  CHARMIAN. Behold, sir.                                    Exit
  CHARMIAN. Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
    The gods themselves do weep.
  CHARMIAN. O Eastern star!
  CHARMIAN. O, break! O, break!
  CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
    Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
    A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
    And golden Phoebus never be beheld
    Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
    I'll mend it and then play-
                  Enter the guard, rushing in
  CHARMIAN. Speak softly, wake her not.
  CHARMIAN. Too slow a messenger.               [Applies an asp]
    O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.
  CHARMIAN. It is well done, and fitting for a princes  
    Descended of so many royal kings.
    Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]
                      Re-enter DOLABELLA

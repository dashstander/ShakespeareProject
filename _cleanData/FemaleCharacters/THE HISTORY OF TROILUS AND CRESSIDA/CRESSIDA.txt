  CRESSIDA. Who were those went by?
  CRESSIDA. And whither go they?
  CRESSIDA. What was his cause of anger?
  CRESSIDA. Good; and what of him?
  CRESSIDA. So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
    legs.
  CRESSIDA. But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector
      angry?
  CRESSIDA. Who comes here?
  CRESSIDA. Hector's a gallant man.
  CRESSIDA. Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
  CRESSIDA. This morning, uncle.
  CRESSIDA. Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.
  CRESSIDA. That were we talking of, and of his anger.
  CRESSIDA. So he says here.
  CRESSIDA. What, is he angry too?
  CRESSIDA. O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
  CRESSIDA. Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
  CRESSIDA. Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.
  CRESSIDA. 'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.
  CRESSIDA. So he is.
  CRESSIDA. He is not Hector.
  CRESSIDA. Excuse me.
  CRESSIDA. Pardon me, pardon me.
  CRESSIDA. He shall not need it if he have his own.
  CRESSIDA. No matter.
  CRESSIDA. 'Twould not become him: his own's better.
  CRESSIDA. No, but brown.
  CRESSIDA. To say the truth, true and not true.
  CRESSIDA. Why, Paris hath colour enough.  
  CRESSIDA. Then Troilus should have too much. If she prais'd him
    above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
    enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
    complexion. I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended
    Troilus for a copper nose.
  CRESSIDA. Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
  CRESSIDA. Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.
  CRESSIDA. Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
  CRESSIDA. Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
  CRESSIDA. O, he smiles valiantly!
  CRESSIDA. O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
  CRESSIDA. Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
  CRESSIDA. If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
  CRESSIDA. Without the rack.
  CRESSIDA. Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.
  CRESSIDA. With millstones.  
  CRESSIDA. But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. Did her eyes run o'er too?
  CRESSIDA. At what was all this laughing?
  CRESSIDA. An't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd too.
  CRESSIDA. What was his answer?
  CRESSIDA. This is her question.
  CRESSIDA. So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
  CRESSIDA. So I do.
  CRESSIDA. And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
    against May.                                    [Sound a retreat]
  CRESSIDA. At your pleasure.
  CRESSIDA. Speak not so loud.
  CRESSIDA. Who's that?
  CRESSIDA. Will he give you the nod?
  CRESSIDA. If he do, the rich shall have more.
                     HECTOR passes
  CRESSIDA. O, a brave man!
  CRESSIDA. Be those with swords?
  CRESSIDA. Who's that?
  CRESSIDA. Can Helenus fight, uncle?
  CRESSIDA. What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
                    TROILUS passes
  CRESSIDA. Peace, for shame, peace!
  CRESSIDA. Here comes more.
                 Common soldiers pass
  CRESSIDA. There is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than
    Troilus.
  CRESSIDA. Well, well.
  CRESSIDA. Ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in  
    the pie, for then the man's date is out.
  CRESSIDA. Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend
    my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to
    defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these; and at all these
    wards I lie at, at a thousand watches.
  CRESSIDA. Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
    chiefest of them too. If I cannot ward what I would not have hit,
    I can watch you for telling how I took the blow; unless it swell
    past hiding, and then it's past watching
  CRESSIDA. Adieu, uncle.
  CRESSIDA. To bring, uncle.
  CRESSIDA. By the same token, you are a bawd.
                                                        Exit PANDARUS
    Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
    He offers in another's enterprise;
    But more in Troilus thousand-fold I see
    Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be,
    Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
    Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
    That she belov'd knows nought that knows not this:
    Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is.
    That she was never yet that ever knew
    Love got so sweet as when desire did sue;
    Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
    Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.
    Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,  
    Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.                 Exit
ACT I. SCENE 3.
The Grecian camp. Before AGAMEMNON'S tent
Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, MENELAUS, and others
  CRESSIDA. Will you walk in, my lord?
  CRESSIDA. Wish'd, my lord! The gods grant-O my lord!
  CRESSIDA. More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
  CRESSIDA. Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer footing
    than blind reason stumbling without fear. To fear the worst oft
    cures the worse.
  CRESSIDA. Nor nothing monstrous neither?
  CRESSIDA. They say all lovers swear more performance than they are
    able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing
    more than the perfection of ten, and discharging less than the
    tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act
    of hares, are they not monsters?
  CRESSIDA. Will you walk in, my lord?
                    Re-enter PANDARUS
  CRESSIDA. Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
  CRESSIDA. Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.
    Prince Troilus, I have lov'd you night and day
    For many weary months.
  CRESSIDA. Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,
    With the first glance that ever-pardon me.  
    If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
    I love you now; but till now not so much
    But I might master it. In faith, I lie;
    My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
    Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
    Why have I blabb'd? Who shall be true to us,
    When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
    But, though I lov'd you well, I woo'd you not;
    And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
    Or that we women had men's privilege
    Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
    For in this rapture I shall surely speak
    The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
    Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
    My very soul of counsel. Stop my mouth.
  CRESSIDA. My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
    'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
    I am asham'd. O heavens! what have I done?  
    For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
  CRESSIDA. Pray you, content you.
  CRESSIDA. Sir, mine own company.
  CRESSIDA. Let me go and try.
    I have a kind of self resides with you;
    But an unkind self, that itself will leave
    To be another's fool. I would be gone.
    Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
  CRESSIDA. Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
    And fell so roundly to a large confession
    To angle for your thoughts; but you are wise-
    Or else you love not; for to be wise and love
    Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
  CRESSIDA. In that I'll war with you.
  CRESSIDA. Prophet may you be!
    If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
    When time is old and hath forgot itself,
    When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
    And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
    And mighty states characterless are grated
    To dusty nothing-yet let memory
    From false to false, among false maids in love,
    Upbraid my falsehood when th' have said 'As false
    As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
    As fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer's calf,
    Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son'-
    Yea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
    'As false as Cressid.'
  CRESSIDA. Amen.
  CRESSIDA. Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
    He shall unbolt the gates.
  CRESSIDA. Good morrow, then.
  CRESSIDA. Are you aweary of me?
  CRESSIDA. Night hath been too brief.
  CRESSIDA. Prithee tarry.
    You men will never tarry.
    O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
    And then you would have tarried. Hark! there's one up.
  CRESSIDA. A pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.
    I shall have such a life!
  CRESSIDA. Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.
    You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
  CRESSIDA. Come, come, beshrew your heart! You'll ne'er be good,  
    Nor suffer others.
  CRESSIDA. Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' th' head!
                                                         [One knocks]
    Who's that at door? Good uncle, go and see.
    My lord, come you again into my chamber.
    You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
  CRESSIDA. Come, you are deceiv'd, I think of no such thing.
   [Knock]
    How earnestly they knock! Pray you come in:
    I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
                                          Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
  CRESSIDA. How now! What's the matter? Who was here?  
  CRESSIDA. Why sigh you so profoundly? Where's my lord? Gone? Tell
    me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
  CRESSIDA. O the gods! What's the matter?
  CRESSIDA. Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you,
    what's the matter?
  CRESSIDA. O you immortal gods! I will not go.
  CRESSIDA. I will not, uncle. I have forgot my father;
    I know no touch of consanguinity,
    No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
    As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,  
    Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
    If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
    Do to this body what extremes you can,
    But the strong base and building of my love
    Is as the very centre of the earth,
    Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep-
  CRESSIDA. Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,
    Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart,
    With sounding 'Troilus.' I will not go from Troy.
    Exeunt
ACT IV. SCENE 3.
Troy. A street before PANDARUS' house
Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES
  CRESSIDA. Why tell you me of moderation?
    The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
    And violenteth in a sense as strong
    As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?
    If I could temporize with my affections
    Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
    The like allayment could I give my grief.
    My love admits no qualifying dross;
    No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
                    Enter TROILUS
  CRESSIDA. O Troilus! Troilus! [Embracing him]
  CRESSIDA. Have the gods envy?
  CRESSIDA. And is it true that I must go from Troy?
  CRESSIDA. What, and from Troilus too?
  CRESSIDA. Is't possible?
  CRESSIDA. I must then to the Grecians?
  CRESSIDA. A woeful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
    When shall we see again?
  CRESSIDA. I true! how now! What wicked deem is this?
  CRESSIDA. O, you shall be expos'd, my lord, to dangers
    As infinite as imminent! But I'll be true.
  CRESSIDA. And you this glove. When shall I see you?
  CRESSIDA. O heavens! 'Be true' again!
  CRESSIDA. O heavens! you love me not.
  CRESSIDA. Do you think I will?
  CRESSIDA. My lord, will you be true?
  CRESSIDA. In kissing, do you render or receive?
  CRESSIDA. I'll make my match to live,
    The kiss you take is better than you give;
    Therefore no kiss.
  CRESSIDA. You are an odd man; give even or give none.
  CRESSIDA. No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true
    That you are odd, and he is even with you.
  CRESSIDA. No, I'll be sworn.
  CRESSIDA. You may.
  CRESSIDA. Why, beg then.
  CRESSIDA. I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.
  CRESSIDA. Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
[Whispers]
  CRESSIDA. Remember? Yes.
  CRESSIDA. Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
  CRESSIDA. I'll tell you what-
  CRESSIDA. In faith, I cannot. What would you have me do?
  CRESSIDA. I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
    Bid me do anything but that, sweet Greek.
  CRESSIDA. Diomed!
  CRESSIDA. Hark! a word in your ear.
  CRESSIDA. Nay, but you part in anger.  
  CRESSIDA. Guardian! Why, Greek!
  CRESSIDA. In faith, I do not. Come hither once again.
  CRESSIDA. In faith, I will, lo; never trust me else.
  CRESSIDA. I'll fetch you one.                                  Exit
  CRESSIDA. Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
  CRESSIDA. You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
    He lov'd me-O false wench!-Give't me again.
  CRESSIDA. It is no matter, now I ha't again.
    I will not meet with you to-morrow night.
    I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
  CRESSIDA. What, this?  
  CRESSIDA. O all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
    Thy master now lies thinking on his bed
    Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
    And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
    As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
    He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
  CRESSIDA. You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
    I'll give you something else.
  CRESSIDA. It is no matter.
  CRESSIDA. 'Twas one's that lov'd me better than you will.
    But, now you have it, take it.
  CRESSIDA. By all Diana's waiting women yond,
    And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
  CRESSIDA. Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past; and yet it is not;
    I will not keep my word.
  CRESSIDA. You shall not go. One cannot speak a word
    But it straight starts you.
  CRESSIDA. Ay, come-O Jove! Do come. I shall be plagu'd.
  CRESSIDA. Good night. I prithee come.                 Exit DIOMEDES
    Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee;
    But with my heart the other eye doth see.
    Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
    The error of our eye directs our mind.  
    What error leads must err; O, then conclude,
    Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.                  Exit

  SECOND WITCH. When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.
  SECOND WITCH. Upon the heath.
  SECOND WITCH. Killing swine.
  SECOND WITCH. I'll give thee a wind.
  SECOND WITCH. Show me, show me.
  SECOND WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
  SECOND WITCH. Hail!
  SECOND WITCH. Not so happy, yet much happier.
  SECOND WITCH. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
  SECOND WITCH. Fillet of a fenny snake,
    In the cauldron boil and bake;
    Eye of newt and toe of frog,
    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
    Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
    Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
    For a charm of powerful trouble,  
    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
  SECOND WITCH. Cool it with a baboon's blood,
    Then the charm is firm and good.  
            Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.
  SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
    Open, locks,
    Whoever knocks!
                      Enter Macbeth.
  SECOND WITCH. Demand.
  SECOND WITCH. Show!

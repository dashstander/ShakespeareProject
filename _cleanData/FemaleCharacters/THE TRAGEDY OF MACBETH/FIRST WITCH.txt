  FIRST WITCH. When shall we three meet again?
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
  FIRST WITCH. Where the place?
  FIRST WITCH. I come, Graymalkin.
  FIRST WITCH. Where hast thou been, sister?
  FIRST WITCH. A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
    And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd. "Give me," quoth I.
    "Aroint thee, witch!" the rump-fed ronyon cries.
    Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;
    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
  FIRST WITCH. Thou'rt kind.
  FIRST WITCH. I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the quarters that they know
    I' the shipman's card.  
    I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his penthouse lid;
    He shall live a man forbid.
    Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;
    Though his bark cannot be lost,
    Yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.
    Look what I have.
  FIRST WITCH. Here I have a pilot's thumb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.                Drum within.
  FIRST WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
  FIRST WITCH. Hail!
  FIRST WITCH. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
  FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
  FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.
  FIRST WITCH. Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
                                                         Exeunt.
SCENE VI.
Forres. The palace.
Enter Lennox and another Lord.
  FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
  FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go;
    In the poison'd entrails throw.
    Toad, that under cold stone
    Days and nights has thirty-one
    Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
    Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
  FIRST WITCH. Speak.
  FIRST WITCH. Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
    Or from our masters'?
  FIRST WITCH. Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten
    Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten  
    From the murtherer's gibbet throw
    Into the flame.
  FIRST WITCH. He knows thy thought:
    Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
  FIRST WITCH. He will not be commanded. Here's another,
    More potent than the first.
          Thunder. Second Apparition: a bloody Child.
  
  FIRST WITCH. Show!  
  FIRST WITCH. Ay, sir, all this is so. But why
    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
    Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
    And show the best of our delights.
    I'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round,
    That this great King may kindly say
    Our duties did his welcome pay.
                                    Music. The Witches dance and
                                        then vanish with Hecate.

  THIRD WITCH. That will be ere the set of sun.
  THIRD WITCH. There to meet with Macbeth.
  THIRD WITCH. Sister, where thou?
  THIRD WITCH. And I another.
  THIRD WITCH. A drum, a drum!
    Macbeth doth come.
  THIRD WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!
  THIRD WITCH. Hail!
  THIRD WITCH. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
  THIRD WITCH. Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time."
  THIRD WITCH. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
    Witch's mummy, maw and gulf
    Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
    Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
    Liver of blaspheming Jew,
    Gall of goat and slips of yew
    Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse,
    Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
    Finger of birth-strangled babe
    Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
    Make the gruel thick and slab.
    Add thereto a tiger's chawdron,
    For the ingredients of our cawdron.
  THIRD WITCH. We'll answer.

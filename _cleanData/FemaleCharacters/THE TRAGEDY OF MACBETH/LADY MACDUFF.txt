  LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land?
  LADY MACDUFF. He had none;
    His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.
  LADY MACDUFF. Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
    His mansion, and his titles, in a place
    From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
    He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
    All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    As little is the wisdom, where the flight
    So runs against all reason.
  LADY MACDUFF. Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
  LADY MACDUFF. Sirrah, your father's dead.
    And what will you do now? How will you live?
  LADY MACDUFF. What, with worms and flies?  
  LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
    The pitfall nor the gin.
  LADY MACDUFF. Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father?
  LADY MACDUFF. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
  LADY MACDUFF. Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i' faith,
    With wit enough for thee.
  LADY MACDUFF. Ay, that he was.
  LADY MACDUFF. Why one that swears and lies.
  LADY MACDUFF. Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be
     hanged.
  LADY MACDUFF. Everyone.  
  LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men.
  LADY MACDUFF. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do
    for a father?
  LADY MACDUFF. Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
                    Enter a Messenger.
  LADY MACDUFF. Whither should I fly?
    I have done no harm. But I remember now
    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
    Is often laudable, to do good sometime
    Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
    Do I put up that womanly defense,
    To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?
                      Enter Murtherers.
  LADY MACDUFF. I hope, in no place so unsanctified
    Where such as thou mayst find him.

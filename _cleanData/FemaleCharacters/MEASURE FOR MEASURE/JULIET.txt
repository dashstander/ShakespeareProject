  JULIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
  JULIET. I'll gladly learn.
  JULIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
  JULIET. Mutually.
  JULIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.
  JULIET. I do repent me as it is an evil,
    And take the shame with joy.
  JULIET. Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
    That respites me a life whose very comfort
    Is still a dying horror!

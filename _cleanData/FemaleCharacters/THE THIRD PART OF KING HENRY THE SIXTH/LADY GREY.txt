  LADY GREY. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
    May it please your Highness to resolve me now;
    And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.
  LADY GREY. Three, my most gracious lord.
  LADY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
  LADY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  LADY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
  LADY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
  LADY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
  LADY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.
  LADY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
  LADY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.  
  LADY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
  LADY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
  LADY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
  LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
  LADY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
    That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
  LADY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
  LADY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive
    Your Highness aims at, if I aim aright.
  LADY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
  LADY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
    For by that loss I will not purchase them.
  LADY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
    But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
    Accords not with the sadness of my suit.
    Please you dismiss me, either with ay or no.
  LADY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
  LADY GREY. 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
    I am a subject fit to jest withal,
    But far unfit to be a sovereign.
  LADY GREY. And that is more than I will yield unto.
    I know I am too mean to be your queen,
    And yet too good to be your concubine.
  LADY GREY. 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.

  FIRST LADY. Come, my gracious lord,
    Shall I be your playfellow?
  FIRST LADY. Why, my sweet lord?
  FIRST LADY. Blue, my lord.
  FIRST LADY. Hark ye:
    The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall
    Present our services to a fine new prince
    One of these days; and then you'd wanton with us,
    If we would have you.

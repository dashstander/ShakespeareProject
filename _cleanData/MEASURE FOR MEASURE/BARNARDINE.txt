  BARNARDINE. [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
    there? What are you?
  BARNARDINE. [ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.
  BARNARDINE. How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you?
  BARNARDINE. You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
    fitted for't.
  BARNARDINE. Friar, not I; I have been drinking hard all night, and
    I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my
    brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that's  
    certain.
  BARNARDINE. I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.
  BARNARDINE. Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to
    my ward; for thence will not I to-day.                  Exit

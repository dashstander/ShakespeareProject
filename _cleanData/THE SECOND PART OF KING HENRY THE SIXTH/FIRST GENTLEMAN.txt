  FIRST GENTLEMAN. What is my ransom, master, let me know?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'll give it, sir: and therefore spare my life.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
    His body will I bear unto the King.
    If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
    So will the Queen, that living held him dear.  
                                              Exit with the body

  MARGARET. Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
    The King of Naples-whosoe'er thou art.
  MARGARET. Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,
    What ransom must I pay before I pass?
    For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
  MARGARET. Why speak'st thou not? What ransom must I
    pay?  
  MARGARET. Wilt thou accept of ransom-yea or no?
  MARGARET. I were best leave him, for he will not hear.
  MARGARET. He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
  MARGARET. And yet I would that you would answer me.
  MARGARET. He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.
  MARGARET. Hear ye, Captain-are you not at leisure?
  MARGARET.  [Aside]  What though I be enthrall'd? He seems
    a knight,
    And will not any way dishonour me.
  MARGARET.  [Aside]  Perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French;
    And then I need not crave his courtesy.
  MARGARET.  [Aside]  Tush! women have been captivate ere
    now.
  MARGARET. I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.
  MARGARET. To be a queen in bondage is more vile
    Than is a slave in base servility;  
    For princes should be free.
  MARGARET. Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
  MARGARET. What?
  MARGARET. I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
  MARGARET. An if my father please, I am content.
  MARGARET. Farewell, my lord. Good wishes, praise, and
    prayers,
    Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.          [She is going]
  MARGARET. Such commendations as becomes a maid,
    A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
  MARGARET. Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,
    Never yet taint with love, I send the King.
  MARGARET. That for thyself, I will not so presume
    To send such peevish tokens to a king.
                                    Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET

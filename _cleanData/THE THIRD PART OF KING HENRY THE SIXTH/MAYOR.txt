  MAYOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
    And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,
    For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
  MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
  MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.
                                                   [He descends]

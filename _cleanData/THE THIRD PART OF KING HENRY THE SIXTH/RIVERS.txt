  RIVERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
  RIVERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
  RIVERS. Then is my sovereign slain?
  RIVERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief;
    Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
    Warwick may lose that now hath won the day.
  RIVERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?

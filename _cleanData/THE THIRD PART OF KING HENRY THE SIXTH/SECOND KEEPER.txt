  SECOND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
  SECOND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
        Enter KING HENRY, disguised, with a prayer-book
  SECOND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
  SECOND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
  SECOND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
  SECOND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
  SECOND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
    Your crown content and you must be contented
    To go along with us; for as we think,
    You are the king King Edward hath depos'd;
    And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
    Will apprehend you as his enemy.
  SECOND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
  SECOND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.

  Mess. He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
  Mess. His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.
  Mess. He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,
    And at the time of my departure thence
    He was much fear'd by his physicians.
  Mess. My lord, here are letters for you.
  Mess. My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.

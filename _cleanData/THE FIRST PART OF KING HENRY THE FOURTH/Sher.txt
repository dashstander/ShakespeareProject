  Sher. First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
    Hath followed certain men unto this house.
  Sher. One of them is well known, my gracious lord-
    A gross fat man.
  Sher. I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
    Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
  Sher. Good night, my noble lord.
  Sher. Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
                                            Exit [with Carrier].

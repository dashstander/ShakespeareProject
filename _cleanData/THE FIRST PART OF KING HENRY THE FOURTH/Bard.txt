  Bard. Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
  Bard. Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them
    bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it
    was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year
    before- I blush'd to hear his monstrous devices.
  Bard. My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these
    exhalations?
  Bard. What think you they portend?
  Bard. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
  Bard. O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most monstrous watch
    is at the door.
  Bard. Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.
  Bard. Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of  
    all compass- out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
  Bard. Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
  Bard. 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
  Bard. Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
  Bard. Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
  Bard. Do, my lord.
  Bard. My lord?
  Bard. Will you give me money, Captain?
  Bard. I Will, Captain. Farewell.                         Exit.

  John. Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
  John. We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,
    Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come.  
                          [Exeunt Prince John and Westmoreland.]
  John. But, soft! whom have we here?
    Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
  John. This is the strangest tale that ever I beard.
  John. I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,
    Which I shall give away immediately.

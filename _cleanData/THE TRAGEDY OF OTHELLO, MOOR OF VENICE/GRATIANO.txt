  GRATIANO. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
  GRATIANO. Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
  GRATIANO. This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
  GRATIANO. Cassio?
  GRATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
  GRATIANO. What, of Venice?
  GRATIANO.                             Know him! ay.
  GRATIANO.                I am glad to see you.
  GRATIANO. Roderigo!
  GRATIANO. What is the matter?
  GRATIANO. 'Tis a strange truth.
  GRATIANO. Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
    Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
    Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,
    This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
    Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.
  GRATIANO.                                    Fie!
    Your sword upon a woman?
  GRATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
  GRATIANO. He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
  GRATIANO. [Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
    Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
  GRATIANO. What is the matter?
  GRATIANO.                    Torments will ope your lips.
  GRATIANO.                  All that's spoke is marr'd.

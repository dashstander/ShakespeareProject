  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
    For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
    The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
    Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.
    I never did like molestation view
    On the enchafed flood.  
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
    Our friends at least.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I shall.                                    Exit.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. They give their greeting to the citadel;
    This likewise is a friend.

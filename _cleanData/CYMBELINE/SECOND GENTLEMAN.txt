  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what's the matter?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You speak him far.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What's his name and birth?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him
    Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
    Is she sole child to th' King?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king's children should be so convey'd,
    So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
    That could not trace them!
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do well believe you.

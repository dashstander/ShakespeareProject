  CAPTAIN. To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia,
    After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
    You here at Milford Haven; with your ships,
    They are in readiness.
  CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
    And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,  
    That promise noble service; and they come
    Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
    Sienna's brother.
  CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o' th' wind.
  CAPTAIN. He's alive, my lord.

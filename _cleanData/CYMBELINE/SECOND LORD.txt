  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
    side the town.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
    face.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
    Puppies!
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a
    fool you were upon the ground.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
    damn'd.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection
    should hurt her.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
    an ass, which is no great hurt.
  SECOND LORD. Well, my lord.                             Exeunt
SCENE III.
Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it
    would have run all out.
  SECOND LORD. No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
    cock, with your comb on.
  SECOND LORD. It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
    companion that you give offence to.
  SECOND LORD. Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
    not.
  SECOND LORD. You cannot derogate, my lord.
  SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues,
    being foolish, do not derogate.
  SECOND LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
                                    Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD
    That such a crafty devil as is his mother
    Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
    Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
    Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
    And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
    Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
    Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
    A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
    More hateful than the foul expulsion is
    Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
    Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
    The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
    That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
    T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!         Exit
SCENE II.

  LADY. The Queen, madam,
    Desires your Highness' company.
  LADY. I, madam.
  LADY. Please you, madam.
  LADY. Almost midnight, madam.
  LADY. Who's there that knocks?
  LADY. No more?  
  LADY. That's more
    Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
    Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
  LADY. Ay,
    To keep her chamber.
  LADY. How? My good name? or to report of you
    What I shall think is good? The Princess!
                        Enter IMOGEN
  LADY. We did, so please your Highness.

  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the
    wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are
    ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought
    with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
    their heads.
  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
    Take it in what sense thou wilt.
  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
    am a pretty piece of flesh.
  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
  Samp. Fear me not.
  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.  
  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.
  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
    thumb, sir.
  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
  Samp. Well, sir.
                        Enter Benvolio.
  Samp. Yes, better, sir.
  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
                                                     They fight.

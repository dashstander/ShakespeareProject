  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
    'Tis now near night.
  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
  Mother. Good night.
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.  
                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
  Mother. What noise is here?
  Mother. What is the matter?
  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Help, help! Call help.
                            Enter Father.
  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
  Mother. O woful time!
  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw  
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!

  Capt. I will do't, my lord.
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
  Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]

  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Fran. Bernardo?
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Fran. Give you good night.
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.                                   Exit.

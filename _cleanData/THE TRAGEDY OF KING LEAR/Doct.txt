  Doct. There is means, madam.
     Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
     The which he lacks. That to provoke in him
     Are many simples operative, whose power
     Will close the eye of anguish.
  Doct. Madam, sleeps still.
  Doct. So please your Majesty
     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
  Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
     I doubt not of his temperance.
  Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!
  Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
  Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
  Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage
     You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger
     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more
     Till further settling.

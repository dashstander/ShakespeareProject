  CAPUCIUS. Madam, the same-your servant.
  CAPUCIUS. Noble lady,
    First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,
    The King's request that I would visit you,
    Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
    Sends you his princely commendations
    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
  CAPUCIUS. Madam, in good health.
  CAPUCIUS. Most willing, madam.
  CAPUCIUS. By heaven, I will,
    Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

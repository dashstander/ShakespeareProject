  SECOND GENTLEMAN. O, God save ye!
    Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become
    Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Were you there?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Pray, speak what has happen'd.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Is he found guilty?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am sorry for't.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But, pray, how pass'd it?  
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That was he
    That fed him with his prophecies?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. After all this, how did he bear him-self
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do not think he fears death.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Certainly
    The Cardinal is the end of this.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That trick of state  
    Was a deep envious one.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. All the commons
    Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,
    Wish him ten fathom deep: this Duke as much
    They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
    The mirror of all courtesy-
      Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment, tip-staves
      before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds
      on each side; accompanied with SIR THOMAS
      LOVELL, SIR NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR WILLIAM SANDYS,
      and common people, etc.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Let's stand close, and behold him.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. If the Duke be guiltless,
    'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
    Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
    Greater than this.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
    A strong faith to conceal it.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am confident.  
    You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear
    A buzzing of a separation
    Between the King and Katharine?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But that slander, sir,
    Is found a truth now; for it grows again
    Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain
    The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal
    Or some about him near have, out of malice
    To the good Queen, possess'd him with a scruple
    That will undo her. To confirm this too,
    Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately;
    As all think, for this business.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I think you have hit the mark; but is't
        not cruel
    That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
    Will have his will, and she must fall.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. So are you.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis all my business. At our last encounter
    The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis well. The citizens,
    I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds-
    As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward-
    In celebration of this day with shows,
    Pageants, and sights of honour.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. May I be bold to ask what that contains,
    That paper in your hand?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thank you, sir; had I not known
      those customs,
    I should have been beholding to your paper.
    But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
    The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Alas, good lady!                       [Trumpets]
    The trumpets sound. Stand close, the Queen is coming.
[Hautboys]
              THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION.
    1. A lively flourish of trumpets.
    2. Then two JUDGES.
    3. LORD CHANCELLOR, with purse and mace before him.
    4. CHORISTERS singing.                                    [Music]
    5. MAYOR OF LONDON, bearing the mace. Then GARTER, in
       his coat of arms, and on his head he wore a gilt copper
       crown.
    6. MARQUIS DORSET, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a  
       demi-coronal of gold. With him, the EARL OF SURREY,
       bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned with an
       earl's coronet. Collars of Esses.
    7. DUKE OF SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet on
       his head, bearing a long white wand, as High Steward.
       With him, the DUKE OF NORFOLK, with the rod of
       marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of Esses.
    8. A canopy borne by four of the CINQUE-PORTS; under it
       the QUEEN in her robe; in her hair richly adorned with
       pearl, crowned. On each side her, the BISHOPS OF LONDON
       and WINCHESTER.
    9. The old DUCHESS OF NORFOLK, in a coronal of gold
       wrought with flowers, bearing the QUEEN'S train.
   10. Certain LADIES or COUNTESSES, with plain circlets of gold
       without flowers.
             Exeunt, first passing over the stage in order and state,
                                and then a great flourish of trumpets
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A royal train, believe me. These know.  
    Who's that that bears the sceptre?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A royal train, believe me. These know.  
    Who's that that bears the sceptre?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A bold brave gentleman. That should be
    The Duke of Suffolk?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And that my Lord of Norfolk?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN.  [Looking on the QUEEN]  Heaven
      bless thee!
    Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
    Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
    Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
    And more and richer, when he strains that lady;
    I cannot blame his conscience.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Those men are happy; and so are all
      are near her.  
    I take it she that carries up the train
    Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed,
    And sometimes falling ones.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You saw
    The ceremony?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Good sir, speak it to us.  
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what follow'd?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What two reverend bishops
    Were those that went on each side of the Queen?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He of Winchester
    Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's,
    The virtuous Cranmer.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Who may that be, I pray you?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He will deserve more.

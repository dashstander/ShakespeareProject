  MRS FORD. Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your
    house.
  MRS FORD. Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to
    the contrary.
  MRS FORD. Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to
    the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel.
  MRS FORD. O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect,
    I could come to such honour!
  MRS FORD. If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment
    or so, I could be knighted.
  MRS FORD. We burn daylight. Here, read, read; perceive
    how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
    men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's
    liking. And yet he would not swear; prais'd women's
    modesty, and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof  
    to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition
    would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no
    more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth
    Psalm to the tune of 'Greensleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
    threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly,
    ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I
    think the best way were to entertain him with hope, till
    the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease.
    Did you ever hear the like?
  MRS FORD. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the
    very words. What doth he think of us?
  MRS FORD. 'Boarding' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
    above deck.
  MRS FORD. Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against
    him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O
    that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food
    to his jealousy.
  MRS FORD. You are the happier woman.
  MRS FORD. How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?
  MRS FORD. Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.
    Will you go, Mistress Page?
                     Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
  MRS FORD.  [Aside to MRS. PAGE]  Trust me, I thought on
    her; she'll fit it.  
  MRS FORD. What, John! what, Robert!
  MRS FORD. I warrant. What, Robin, I say!
                 Enter SERVANTS with a basket
  MRS FORD. Here, set it down.
  MRS FORD. Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
    ready here hard by in the brew-house; and when I suddenly
    call you, come forth, and, without any pause or
    staggering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done,
    trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters
    in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch
    close by the Thames side.  
  Mrs. PAGE. You will do it?
  MRS FORD. I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
    direction. Be gone, and come when you are call'd.
                                               Exeunt SERVANTS
  MRS FORD. I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
    direction. Be gone, and come when you are call'd.
                                               Exeunt SERVANTS
  MRS FORD. How now, my eyas-musket, what news with
    you?
  MRS FORD. Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.  [Exit  
  ROBIN]  Mistress Page, remember you your cue.
  MRS FORD. Go to, then; we'll use this unwholesome
    humidity, this gross wat'ry pumpion; we'll teach him to
    know turtles from jays.
                      Enter FALSTAFF
  MRS FORD. O sweet Sir John!
  MRS FORD. I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful
    lady.
  MRS FORD. A plain kerchief, Sir John; my brows become
    nothing else, nor that well neither.
  MRS FORD. Believe me, there's no such thing in me.
  MRS FORD. Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress
    Page.  
  MRS FORD. Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you
    shall one day find it.
  MRS FORD. Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could
    not be in that mind.
  MRS FORD. Pray you, do so; she's a very tattling woman.
                                      [FALSTAFF hides himself]
               Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN
    What's the matter? How now!
  MRS FORD. What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
  MRS FORD. What cause of suspicion?
  MRS FORD. Why, alas, what's the matter?
  MRS FORD. 'Tis not so, I hope.
  MRS FORD. What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear
    friend; and I fear not mine own shame as much as his peril.
    I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the
    house.
  MRS FORD. He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?
  MRS FORD. What, John! Robert! John!                Exit ROBIN
                 Re-enter SERVANTS
    Go, take up these clothes here, quickly; where's the
    cowl-staff? Look how you drumble. Carry them to the laundress
    in Datchet Mead; quickly, come.
         Enter FORD, PAGE, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
  MRS FORD. Why, what have you to do whither they bear it?
    You were best meddle with buck-washing.  
  MRS FORD. I know not which pleases me better, that my
    husband is deceived, or Sir John.  
  MRS FORD. I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
    throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
  MRS FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion
    of Falstaff's being here, for I never saw him so gross in his
    jealousy till now.
  MRS FORD. Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
    Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water,
    and give him another hope, to betray him to another
    punishment?
  MRS FORD. You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
  MRS FORD. Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
  MRS FORD. He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.
  MRS FORD. Step into th' chamber, Sir John.      Exit FALSTAFF
                      Enter MISTRESS PAGE
  MRS FORD. Why, none but mine own people.
  MRS FORD. No, certainly.  [Aside to her]  Speak louder.
  MRS FORD. Why?
  MRS FORD. Why, does he talk of him?
  MRS FORD. How near is he, Mistress Page?
  MRS FORD. I am undone: the knight is here.
  MRS FORD. Which way should he go? How should I bestow
    him? Shall I put him into the basket again?
                  Re-enter FALSTAFF
  MRS FORD. There they always use to discharge their
    birding-pieces.
  MRS FORD. He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,  
    coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract for
    the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his
    note. There is no hiding you in the house.
  MRS FORD. How might we disguise him?
  MRS FORD. My Maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brainford, has
    a gown above.
  MRS FORD. Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will
    look some linen for your head.
  MRS FORD. I would my husband would meet him in this
    shape; he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford; he
    swears she's a witch, forbade her my house, and hath
    threat'ned to beat her.
  MRS FORD. But is my husband coming?
  MRS FORD. We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry
    the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they
    did last time.
  MRS FORD. I'll first direct my men what they shall do with
    the basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.   Exit
  MRS FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders;
    your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it down, obey
    him; quickly, dispatch.                                 Exit
  MRS FORD. Heaven be my witness, you do, if you suspect
    me in any dishonesty.
  MRS FORD. Are you not asham'd? Let the clothes alone.  
  MRS FORD. Why, man, why?
  MRS FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's
    death.
  MRS FORD. What, hoa, Mistress Page! Come you and the old
    woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.
  MRS FORD. Why, it is my maid's aunt of Brainford.
  MRS FORD. Nay, good sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let
    him not strike the old woman.
   Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and MISTRESS PAGE
  
  MRS FORD. Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.
  MRS FORD. Nay, by th' mass, that he did not; he beat him
    most unpitifully methought.  
  MRS FORD. What think you? May we, with the warrant of
    womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue
    him with any further revenge?
  MRS FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd
    him?
  MRS FORD. I'll warrant they'll have him publicly sham'd;
    and methinks there would be no period to the jest, should
    he not be publicly sham'd.
  MRS FORD. Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
    And let us two devise to bring him thither.
  MRS FORD. Marry, this is our device-
    That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,
    Disguis'd, like Heme, with huge horns on his head.
  MRS FORD. And till he tell the truth,
    Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound,
    And burn him with their tapers.
  MRS FORD. Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and
    the Welsh devil, Hugh?
  MRS FORD. That cannot choose but amaze him.
  MRS FORD. We'll betray him finely.
  MRS FORD. The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
                                                          Exeunt
SCENE 4.
Windsor Park
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS like a satyr, with OTHERS as fairies
  MRS FORD. Sir John! Art thou there, my deer, my male deer.
  MRS FORD. Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
  MRS FORD. Heaven forgive our sins!
  MRS FORD. } Away, away.
  MRS FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never  
    meet. I will never take you for my love again; but I will
    always count you my deer.

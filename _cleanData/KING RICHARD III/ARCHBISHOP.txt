  ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
    And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
    To-morrow or next day they will be here.
  ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
  ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.
  ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?
  ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?
  ARCHBISHOP.  [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
    And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
    For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
    The seal I keep; and so betide to me
    As well I tender you and all of yours!
    Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt

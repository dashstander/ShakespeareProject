  YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
    My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
    More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester
    'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'
    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.  
  YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
    I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout
    To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
  YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
    That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
    'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
    Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
  YORK. Grandam, his nurse.
  YORK. If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.  
  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.  
  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
    The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  YORK. And therefore is he idle?
  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.
  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
    And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
  YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!  
  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:
    In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
  YORK. Little.
  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
    Because that I am little, like an ape,
    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
    My grandam told me he was murder'd there.

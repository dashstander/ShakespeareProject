  THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty
    Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
    Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;
    And he himself wand'red away alone,
    No man knows whither.
  THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made,
    my Lord.
                      Enter another MESSENGER

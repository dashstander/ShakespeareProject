  NURSE. Good morrow, lords.
    O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
  NURSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
    Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
  NURSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
    Our Empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace!
    She is delivered, lord; she is delivered.
  NURSE. I mean she is brought a-bed.
  NURSE. A devil.
  NURSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad  
    Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime;
    The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
    And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
  NURSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
  NURSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  NURSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  NURSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself;
    And no one else but the delivered Empress.

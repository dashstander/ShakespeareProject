  GENTLEMAN. And you.
  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.
  GENTLEMAN. What's your will?
  GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.
  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.
    He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
    Than is his use.
  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
    Whither I am going.  
  GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.
  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,
    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,  
    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
    To tender it herself. I undertook it,
    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
    Is here attending; her business looks in her
    With an importing visage; and she told me
    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
    Your Highness with herself.

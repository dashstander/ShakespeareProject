  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
    Thither we bend again.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;
    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
    The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
    That good convenience claims.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,
    In that and all your worthiest affairs.

  Balth. Well, I would you did like me.
  Balth. Which is one?
  Balth. I love you the better. The hearers may cry Amen.
  Balth. Amen.
  Balth. No more words. The clerk is answered.
                                              [Takes her aside.]
  Balth. O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
    To slander music any more than once.
  Balth. Because you talk of wooing, I will sing,
    Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
    To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
    Yet will he swear he loves.
  Balth. Note this before my notes:
    There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
  Balth. And an ill singer, my lord.
  Balth. The best I can, my lord.

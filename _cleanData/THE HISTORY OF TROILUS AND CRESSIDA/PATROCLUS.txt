  PATROCLUS. Good words, Thersites.
  PATROCLUS. No more words, Thersites; peace!
  PATROCLUS. A good riddance.
  PATROCLUS. Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and
    rail.
  PATROCLUS. What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?
  PATROCLUS. Amen.
                      Enter ACHILLES
  
  PATROCLUS. Thersites, my lord.
  PATROCLUS. Thy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what's
    Thersites?
  PATROCLUS. Thou must tell that knowest.
  PATROCLUS. You rascal!
  PATROCLUS. Why am I a fool?
  PATROCLUS. Within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.  
  PATROCLUS. I shall say so to him.                              Exit
  PATROCLUS. Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
    If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
    Did move your greatness and this noble state
    To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
    But for your health and your digestion sake,
    An after-dinner's breath.
  PATROCLUS. I shall, and bring his answer presently.            Exit
  PATROCLUS. They pass by strangely. They were us'd to bend,
    To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
    To come as humbly as they us'd to creep
    To holy altars.
  PATROCLUS. To this effect, Achilles, have I mov'd you.
    A woman impudent and mannish grown
    Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
    In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
    They think my little stomach to the war
    And your great love to me restrains you thus.
    Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
    Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,  
    And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
    Be shook to airy air.
  PATROCLUS. Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
  PATROCLUS. O, then, beware:
    Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves;
    Omission to do what is necessary
    Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
    And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
    Even then when they sit idly in the sun.
  PATROCLUS. Jove bless great Ajax!
  PATROCLUS. I come from the worthy Achilles-
  PATROCLUS. Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his  
    tent-
  PATROCLUS. And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.
  PATROCLUS. Ay, my lord.
  PATROCLUS. What you say to't?
  PATROCLUS. Your answer, sir.
  PATROCLUS. Your answer, sir.
  PATROCLUS. But that's no argument for kissing now;
    For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
    And parted thus you and your argument.
  PATROCLUS. The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine-
                                                   [Kisses her again]
    Patroclus kisses you.
  PATROCLUS. Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
  PATROCLUS. Both take and give.
  PATROCLUS. Here comes Thersites.
                   Enter THERSITES
  PATROCLUS. Who keeps the tent now?
  PATROCLUS. Well said, Adversity! and what needs these tricks?
  PATROCLUS. Male varlet, you rogue! What's that?
  PATROCLUS. Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou
    to curse thus?
  PATROCLUS. Why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson
    indistinguishable cur, no.
  PATROCLUS. Out, gall!

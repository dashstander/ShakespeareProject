  HELEN. Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
  HELEN. He is full of harmony.
  HELEN. O, sir-
  HELEN. Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We'll hear you sing,
    certainly-
  HELEN. My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord-
  HELEN. You shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our
    melancholy upon your head!
  HELEN. And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
  HELEN. My Lord Pandarus!
  HELEN. Nay, but, my lord-  
  HELEN. You must not know where he sups.
  HELEN. Why, this is kindly done.
  HELEN. She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.
  HELEN. Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
  HELEN. Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a
    fine forehead.
  HELEN. Let thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid,
    Cupid, Cupid!
  HELEN. In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
  HELEN. He hangs the lip at something. You know all, Lord Pandarus.
  HELEN. Commend me to your niece.
  HELEN. 'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
    Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
    Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
    Yea, overshines ourself.

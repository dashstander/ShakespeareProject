  COLVILLE. I am a knight sir; and my name is Colville of the Dale.
  COLVILLE. Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
  COLVILLE. I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought
    yield me.
  COLVILLE. It is, my lord.
  COLVILLE. I am, my lord, but as my betters are
    That led me hither. Had they been rul'd by me,
    You should have won them dearer than you have.

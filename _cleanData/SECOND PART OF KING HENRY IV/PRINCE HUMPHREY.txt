  PRINCE HUMPHREY. I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. I do not know, my lord.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. No, my good lord, he is in presence here.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. Comfort, your Majesty!
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. The people fear me; for they do observe
    Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature.
    The seasons change their manners, as the year
    Had found some months asleep, and leapt them over.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. This apoplexy will certain be his end.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. Exceeding ill.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. He alt'red much upon the hearing it.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
  PRINCE HUMPHREY. O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;
    And I dare swear you borrow not that face
    Of seeming sorrow- it is sure your own.

  FEEBLE. Here, sir.  
  FEEBLE. A woman's tailor, sir.
  FEEBLE. I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
  FEEBLE. I would Wart might have gone, sir.
  FEEBLE. It shall suffice, sir.
  FEEBLE. By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God
    a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind. An't be my destiny, so;
    an't be not, so. No man's too good to serve 's Prince; and, let
    it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the
    next.
  FEEBLE. Faith, I'll bear no base mind.

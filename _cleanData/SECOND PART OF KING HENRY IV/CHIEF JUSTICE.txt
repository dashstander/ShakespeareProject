  CHIEF JUSTICE. What's he that goes there?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. He that was in question for the robb'ry?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What, to York? Call him back again.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good.
    Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
    Shrewsbury.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I
    sent for you.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I think you are fall'n into the disease, for you
    hear not what I say to you.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. To punish you by the heels would amend the attention
    of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I sent for you, when there were matters against you
    for your life, to come speak with me.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great
    infamy.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Your means are very slender, and your waste is
    great.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. You have misled the youthful Prince.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd wound. Your
    day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your
    night's exploit on Gadshill. You may thank th' unquiet time for
    your quiet o'erposting that action.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
    sleeping wolf.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
    out.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. There is not a white hair in your face but should
    have his effect of gravity.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. You follow the young Prince up and down, like his
    ill angel.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
    that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have
    you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a
    decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken,
    your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every
    part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call
    yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, God send the Prince a better companion!
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the King hath sever'd you. I hear you are
    going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the
    Earl of Northumberland.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your  
    expedition!
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to
    bear crosses. Fare you well. Commend me to my cousin
    Westmoreland.
                                Exeunt CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What is the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!
  CHIEF JUSTICE. How now, Sir John! what, are you brawling here?  
    Doth this become your place, your time, and business?
    You should have been well on your way to York.
    Stand from him, fellow; wherefore hang'st thou upon him?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. For what sum?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good
    temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not
    ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by
    her own?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
    manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a  
    confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more
    than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level
    consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practis'd upon the
    easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses
    both in purse and in person.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and
    unpay the villainy you have done with her; the one you may do
    with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in
    th' effect of your reputation, and satisfy the poor woman.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, Master Gower, what news?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I have heard better news.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Where lay the King to-night?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Come all his forces back?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. You shall have letters of me presently.
    Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.  
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What's the matter?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to
    take soldiers up in counties as you go.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir
    John?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, the Lord lighten thee! Thou art a great fool.
                                                          Exeunt
SCENE II.
London. Another street
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
  CHIEF JUSTICE. How doth the King?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I hope, not dead.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I would his Majesty had call'd me with him.
    The service that I truly did his life
    Hath left me open to all injuries.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I know he doth not, and do arm myself
    To welcome the condition of the time,
    Which cannot look more hideously upon me
    Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.
              Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER,  
                     WESTMORELAND, and others
  CHIEF JUSTICE. O God, I fear all will be overturn'd.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sweet Princes, what I did, I did in honour,
    Led by th' impartial conduct of my soul;
    And never shall you see that I will beg
    A ragged and forestall'd remission.
    If truth and upright innocency fail me,
    I'll to the King my master that is dead,
    And tell him who hath sent me after him.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Good morrow, and God save your Majesty!
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I am assur'd, if I be measur'd rightly,
    Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I then did use the person of your father;
    The image of his power lay then in me;
    And in th' administration of his law,
    Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
    Your Highness pleased to forget my place,
    The majesty and power of law and justice,
    The image of the King whom I presented,
    And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
    Whereon, as an offender to your father,
    I gave bold way to my authority
    And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
    Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
    To have a son set your decrees at nought,
    To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
    To trip the course of law, and blunt the sword
    That guards the peace and safety of your person;  
    Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image,
    And mock your workings in a second body.
    Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
    Be now the father, and propose a son;
    Hear your own dignity so much profan'd,
    See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
    Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
    And then imagine me taking your part
    And, in your power, soft silencing your son.
    After this cold considerance, sentence me;
    And, as you are a king, speak in your state
    What I have done that misbecame my place,
    My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Have you your wits? Know you what 'tis you speak?
  CHIEF JUSTICE. Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;
    Take all his company along with him.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.
    Take them away.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. And so they are.
  CHIEF JUSTICE. He hath.

  SERVANT. Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
  SERVANT. He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at
    Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the  
    Lord John of Lancaster.
  SERVANT. Sir John Falstaff!
  SERVANT. Sir John!
  SERVANT. You mistake me, sir.
  SERVANT. I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your
    soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you you in your
    throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man.  
  SERVANT. Sir, my lord would speak with you.

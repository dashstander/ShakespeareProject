  ORLEANS. You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his
    due.
  ORLEANS. Will it never be morning?
  ORLEANS. You are as well provided of both as any prince in the
    world.
  ORLEANS. He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
  ORLEANS. No more, cousin.
  ORLEANS. I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
  ORLEANS. Your mistress bears well.
  ORLEANS. The Dauphin longs for morning.
  ORLEANS. By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
  ORLEANS. He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
  ORLEANS. He never did harm that I heard of.
  ORLEANS. I know him to be valiant.
  ORLEANS. What's he?
  ORLEANS. He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.  
  ORLEANS. Ill-wind never said well.
  ORLEANS. And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
  ORLEANS. You are the better at proverbs by how much 'A fool's bolt
    is soon shot.'
  ORLEANS. 'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
                          Enter a MESSENGER
  ORLEANS. What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of
    England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers so far out of his
    knowledge!
  ORLEANS. That they lack; for if their heads had any intellectual
    armour, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.
  ORLEANS. Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian
    bear, and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples! You may as
    well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the
    lip of a lion.
  ORLEANS. Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
  ORLEANS. It is now two o'clock; but let me see- by ten
    We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.              Exeunt
ACT IV. PROLOGUE.
Enter CHORUS
  ORLEANS. The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!
  ORLEANS. O brave spirit!
  ORLEANS. Rien puis? L'air et le feu.
  ORLEANS. O Seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!
  ORLEANS. Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
  ORLEANS. We are enow yet living in the field
    To smother up the English in our throngs,
    If any order might be thought upon.

  AUSTRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
    As seal to this indenture of my love:
    That to my home I will no more return
    Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
    Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore,
    Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
    And coops from other lands her islanders-
    Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main,
    That water-walled bulwark, still secure
    And confident from foreign purposes-
    Even till that utmost corner of the west
    Salute thee for her king. Till then, fair boy,
    Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
  AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords  
    In such a just and charitable war.
  AUSTRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
    We must awake endeavour for defence,
    For courage mounteth with occasion.
    Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.
       Enter KING JOHN, ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD,
                 PEMBROKE, and others
  AUSTRIA. Peace!
  AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou?
  AUSTRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
    With this abundance of superfluous breath?
    King Philip, determine what we shall do straight.
  AUSTRIA. Peace! no more.
  AUSTRIA. I from the north.
  AUSTRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
    That I did so when I was first assur'd.
  AUSTRIA. Lady Constance, peace!
  AUSTRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
  AUSTRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
  AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
  AUSTRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
    Because-
  AUSTRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
  AUSTRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!

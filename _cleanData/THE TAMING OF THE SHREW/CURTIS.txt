  CURTIS. Who is that calls so coldly?
  CURTIS. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?  
  CURTIS. Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
  CURTIS. Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
  CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
  CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
  CURTIS. Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
  CURTIS. All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
  CURTIS. How?
  CURTIS. Let's ha't, good Grumio.
  CURTIS. Here.
  CURTIS. This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
  CURTIS. Both of one horse?
  CURTIS. Why, a horse.
  CURTIS. By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
  CURTIS. They are.
  CURTIS. Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to countenance my
    mistress.
  CURTIS. Who knows not that?
  CURTIS. I call them forth to credit her.
  CURTIS. In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
    And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
    Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
    And sits as one new risen from a dream.
    Away, away! for he is coming hither.                  Exeunt
                       Re-enter PETRUCHIO

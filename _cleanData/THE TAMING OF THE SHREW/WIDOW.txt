  WIDOW. Then never trust me if I be afeard.
  WIDOW. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
  WIDOW. Thus I conceive by him.
  WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
    Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;
    And now you know my meaning.
  WIDOW. Right, I mean you.
  WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
    Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
  WIDOW. Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
  WIDOW. She shall not.

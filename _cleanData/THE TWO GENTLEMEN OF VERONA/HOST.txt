  HOST. Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly; I pray you,
    why is it?
  HOST. Come, we'll have you merry; I'll bring you where you shall
    hear music, and see the gentleman that you ask'd for.  
  HOST. Ay, that you shall.                        [Music plays]
  HOST. Hark, hark!
  HOST. Ay; but peace! let's hear 'em.
                   SONG
         Who is Silvia? What is she,
           That all our swains commend her?
         Holy, fair, and wise is she;
           The heaven such grace did lend her,
         That she might admired be.
         Is she kind as she is fair?
           For beauty lives with kindness.
         Love doth to her eyes repair,
           To help him of his blindness;
         And, being help'd, inhabits there.
  
         Then to Silvia let us sing
           That Silvia is excelling;
         She excels each mortal thing
           Upon the dull earth dwelling.
         'To her let us garlands bring.
  HOST. How now, are you sadder than you were before?
    How do you, man? The music likes you not.
  HOST. How now, are you sadder than you were before?
    How do you, man? The music likes you not.
  HOST. Why, my pretty youth?
  HOST. How, out of tune on the strings?
  HOST. You have a quick ear.
  HOST. I perceive you delight not in music.
  HOST. Hark, what fine change is in the music!
  HOST. You would have them always play but one thing?
  HOST. I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov'd her out of
    all nick.
  HOST. Gone to seek his dog, which to-morrow, by his master's
    command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
  HOST. By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
  HOST. Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.

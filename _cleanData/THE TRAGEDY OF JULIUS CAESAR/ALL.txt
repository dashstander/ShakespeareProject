  ALL. None, Brutus, none.
  ALL. Live, Brutus, live, live!
  ALL. Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
  ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
  ALL. The will! The testament!
  ALL. Come down.
  ALL. Stand back; room, bear back!
  ALL. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!
    Slay! Let not a traitor live!
  ALL. We'll mutiny.
  ALL. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
  ALL. Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.
  ALL. Peace, ho!

  FOURTH CITIZEN. Caesar's better parts
    Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. What does he say of Brutus?
  FOURTH CITIZEN. 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
    You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.  
  FOURTH CITIZEN. They were traitors. Honorable men!
  FOURTH CITIZEN. A ring, stand round.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. O traitors villains!
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
                                  Exeunt Citizens with the body.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Are you a married man or a bachelor?
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, and wisely.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. For your dwelling, briefly.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad
    verses.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but his
    name out of his heart, and turn him going.

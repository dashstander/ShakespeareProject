  CINNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
  CINNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
    There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
  CINNA. Yes, you are.
    O Cassius, if you could
    But win the noble Brutus to our party-
  CINNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
    To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
    And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
  CINNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
    That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
  CINNA. No, by no means.
  CINNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
  CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
  CINNA. O Caesar-
  CINNA. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.  
  CINNA. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
  CINNA. I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
    And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
    I have no will to wander forth of doors,
    Yet something leads me forth.
                        Enter Citizens.
  CINNA. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I
    a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly  
    and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
  CINNA. Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
  CINNA. As a friend.
  CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
  CINNA. Truly, my name is Cinna.
  CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
  CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.

  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!
  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.
  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.
  SOOTHSAYER. At mine own house, good lady.
  SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady.
  SOOTHSAYER. Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand
    To see him pass on to the Capitol.
  SOOTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar
    To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,  
    I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
  SOOTHSAYER. None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
    Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,
    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
    Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
    I'll get me to a place more void and there
    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.               Exit.
  SOOTHSAYER. Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
  A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.

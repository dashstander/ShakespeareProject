  LIGARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  LIGARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
    Any exploit worthy the name of honor.  
  LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,
    I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
    Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
    Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
    My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
    And I will strive with things impossible,
    Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
  LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
  LIGARIUS. Set on your foot,
    And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
    To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
    That Brutus leads me on.

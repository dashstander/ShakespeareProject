  FIRST CITIZEN. I will hear Brutus speak.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
  FIRST CITIZEN. We'll bring him to his house with shouts and
    clamors.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace, ho!
  FIRST CITIZEN. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.
  FIRST CITIZEN. This Caesar was a tyrant.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
  FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
  FIRST CITIZEN. O piteous spectacle!
  FIRST CITIZEN. O most bloody sight!
  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.  
  FIRST CITIZEN. We'll burn the house of Brutus.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Never, never. Come, away, away!
    We'll burn his body in the holy place
    And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
    Take up the body.
  FIRST CITIZEN. What is your name?
  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, and briefly.
  FIRST CITIZEN. As a friend or an enemy?
  FIRST CITIZEN. Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.

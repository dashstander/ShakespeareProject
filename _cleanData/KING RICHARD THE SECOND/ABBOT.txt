  ABBOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
  ABBOT. My lord,
    Before I freely speak my mind herein,
    You shall not only take the sacrament
    To bury mine intents, but also to effect
    Whatever I shall happen to devise.
    I see your brows are full of discontent,
    Your hearts of sorrow, and your eyes of tears.  
    Come home with me to supper; I will lay
    A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
ACT V. SCENE 1.
London. A street leading to the Tower
Enter the QUEEN, with her attendants

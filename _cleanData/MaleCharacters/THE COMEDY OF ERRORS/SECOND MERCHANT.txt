SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
  And since I have not much importun'd you;
  Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
  To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
  Therefore make present satisfaction,
  Or I'll attach you by this officer.
SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
SECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.
  Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;
  If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
  Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
  To walk where any honest men resort.
SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
[They draw]
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTESAN, and OTHERS
SECOND MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;
  Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
  The place of death and sorry execution,
  Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
  Who put unluckily into this bay
  Against the laws and statutes of this town,
  Beheaded publicly for his offence.
SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
  Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
  After you first forswore it on the mart;
  And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
  And then you fled into this abbey here,
  From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

  FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Nothing. What news?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, sir, good night.
                                      [They meet other soldiers]
  FIRST SOLDIER. And you. Good night, good night.
                [The two companies separate and place themselves
                                   in every corner of the stage]
  FIRST SOLDIER. Ay; is't not strange?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
    Let's see how it will give off.

  FIRST GUARD. What's the noise?
  FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period.  
  FIRST GUARD. Not I.
  FIRST GUARD. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear

  FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
    Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves  
    Upon the caves of Nile.

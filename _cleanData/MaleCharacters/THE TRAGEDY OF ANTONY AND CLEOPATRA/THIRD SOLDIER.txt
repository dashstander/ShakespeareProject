  THIRD SOLDIER. 'Tis a brave army,
    And full of purpose.
                      [Music of the hautboys is under the stage]  
  THIRD SOLDIER. List, list!
  THIRD SOLDIER. Music i' th' air.
  THIRD SOLDIER. It signs well, does it not?
  THIRD SOLDIER. Peace, I say!
    What should this mean?
  THIRD SOLDIER. Walk; let's see if other watchmen
    Do hear what we do.
  THIRD SOLDIER. Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?

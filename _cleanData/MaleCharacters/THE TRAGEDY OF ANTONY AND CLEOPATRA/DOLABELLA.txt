  DOLABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
    An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
    He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
    Which had superfluous kings for messengers
    Not many moons gone by.
            Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY
  DOLABELLA. Caesar, I shall.                               Exit
             Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY
  DOLABELLA. Proculeius,
    What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
    And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
    I'll take her to my guard.
  DOLABELLA. Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
  DOLABELLA. Assuredly you know me.
  DOLABELLA. I understand not, madam.
  DOLABELLA. If it might please ye-
  DOLABELLA. Most sovereign creature-
  DOLABELLA. Cleopatra-
  DOLABELLA. Gentle madam, no.
  DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.
    Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
    As answering to the weight. Would I might never  
    O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
    By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
    My very heart at root.
  DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
  DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-
  DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
                              [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']
       Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
                     and others of his train
  DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]
  DOLABELLA. Where's the Queen?
  DOLABELLA. Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
    Which my love makes religion to obey,
    I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
    Intends his journey, and within three days
    You with your children will he send before.
    Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
    Your pleasure and my promise.
  DOLABELLA. I your servant.
    Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.
  DOLABELLA. How goes it here?
  DOLABELLA. Caesar, thy thoughts
    Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
    To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
    So sought'st to hinder.
                      [Within: 'A way there, a way for Caesar!']
              Re-enter CAESAR and all his train
  DOLABELLA. O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
    That you did fear is done.
  DOLABELLA. O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
    That you did fear is done.
  DOLABELLA. Who was last with them?
  DOLABELLA. Here on her breast
    There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
    The like is on her arm.

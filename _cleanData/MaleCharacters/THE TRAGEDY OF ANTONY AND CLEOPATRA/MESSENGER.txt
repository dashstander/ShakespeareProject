  MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.
  MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
  MESSENGER. Ay.
    But soon that war had end, and the time's state
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
    Whose better issue in the war from Italy
    Upon the first encounter drave them.  
  MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.
  MESSENGER. Labienus-
    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
    Extended Asia from Euphrates,
    His conquering banner shook from Syria
    To Lydia and to Ionia,
    Whilst-
  MESSENGER. O, my lord!
  MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
  MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
    And it appears he is belov'd of those
    That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
    The discontents repair, and men's reports
    Give him much wrong'd.
  MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound  
    With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
    They make in Italy; the borders maritime
    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
    No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
    Than could his war resisted.
  MESSENGER. Madam, madam-
  MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  MESSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
  MESSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
  MESSENGER. But yet, madam-
  MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
    He's bound unto Octavia.
  MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.
  MESSENGER. Gracious madam,
    I that do bring the news made not the match.
  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.  
  MESSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit
  MESSENGER. I have done my duty.
  MESSENGER. He's married, madam.
  MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
  MESSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.
  MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;
    To punish me for what you make me do
    Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.
  MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!
  MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.
  MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome
    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
    Between her brother and Mark Antony.
  MESSENGER. She is not, madam.
  MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
  MESSENGER. She creeps.
    Her motion and her station are as one;
    She shows a body rather than a life,
    A statue than a breather.
  MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.
  MESSENGER. Madam,
    She was a widow.
  MESSENGER. And I do think she's thirty.
  MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.
  MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead
    As low as she would wish it.
  MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
    Caesar has taken Toryne.
  MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.
  MESSENGER. Antony
    Is come into the field.

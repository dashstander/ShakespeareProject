  ALEXAS. Soothsayer!
  ALEXAS. Show him your hand.
                       Enter ENOBARBUS
  ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
  ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.
  ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
  ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.
  ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
    would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!
                          Enter CLEOPATRA
  ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants
  ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
  ALEXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
    'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
    To mend the petty present, I will piece
    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
    Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,  
    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
    Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
    Was beastly dumb'd by him.
  ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
  ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
    Why do you send so thick?
  ALEXAS. Half afeard to come.
  ALEXAS. Good Majesty,
    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
    But when you are well pleas'd.

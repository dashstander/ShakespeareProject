  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
    have not deserved nobly.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have  
    been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common
    people.
  FOURTH CITIZEN. You have received many wounds for your country.

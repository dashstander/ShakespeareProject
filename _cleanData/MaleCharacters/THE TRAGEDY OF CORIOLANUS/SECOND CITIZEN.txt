  SECOND CITIZEN. One word, good citizens.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his
    country?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, but speak not maliciously.
  SECOND CITIZEN. What he cannot help in his nature you account a
    vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd
    the people.
  SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we will.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
    fly?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way?
  SECOND CITIZEN. YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you
    may.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Your own desert?
  SECOND CITIZEN. You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
  SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.
                                       Exeunt the three citizens
                      Re-enter two other citizens
  SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,  
    He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
    He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us
    His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.
  SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I.
  SECOND CITIZEN. So did we all. But come, let's home.
                                                 Exeunt citizens

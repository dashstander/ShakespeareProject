  LARTIUS. No, Caius Marcius;
    I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
    Ere stay behind this business.
  LARTIUS.  [To COMINIUS]  Lead you on.
    [To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
    Right worthy you priority.
  LARTIUS. My horse to yours- no.
  LARTIUS. Agreed.
  LARTIUS. So, the good horse is mine.
  LARTIUS. No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
    For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
  LARTIUS. Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
                   Enter the army of the Volsces
  LARTIUS. What is become of Marcius?  
  LARTIUS. O noble fellow!
    Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
    And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
    A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
    Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
    Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
    Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
    The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
    Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
    Were feverous and did tremble.
          Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy
  LARTIUS. O, 'tis Marcius!  
    Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
                            [They fight, and all enter the city]
SCENE V.
Within Corioli. A street
Enter certain Romans, with spoils
  LARTIUS. Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
    Thy exercise hath been too violent
    For a second course of fight.
  LARTIUS. Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
    Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
    Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
    Prosperity be thy page!
  LARTIUS. Thou worthiest Marcius!                  Exit MARCIUS
    Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
    Call thither all the officers o' th' town,
    Where they shall know our mind. Away!                 Exeunt
SCENE VI.
Near the camp of COMINIUS
Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers
  LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
    As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
    Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
    For a short holding. If we lose the field
    We cannot keep the town.
  LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
    Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.       Exeunt
SCENE VIII.
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
Alarum, as in battle. Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several doors
  LARTIUS. O General,  
    Here is the steed, we the caparison.
    Hadst thou beheld-
  LARTIUS. I shall, my lord.
  LARTIUS. Marcius, his name?
  LARTIUS. He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
    Our swifter composition.
  LARTIUS. On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
    Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
    Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.
  LARTIUS. He did, my lord.
  LARTIUS. How often he had met you, sword to sword;
    That of all things upon the earth he hated
    Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
    To hopeless restitution, so he might
    Be call'd your vanquisher.
  LARTIUS. At Antium.

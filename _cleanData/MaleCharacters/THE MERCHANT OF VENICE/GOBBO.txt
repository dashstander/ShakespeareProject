  GOBBO. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
    master Jew's?
  GOBBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
    master Jew's?
  GOBBO. Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell
    me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or
    no?
  GOBBO. No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
    say't, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well
    to live.
  GOBBO. Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
  GOBBO. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
  GOBBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
    very prop.
  GOBBO. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
    you tell me, is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead?
  GOBBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
  GOBBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my
    boy.
  GOBBO. I cannot think you are my son.
  GOBBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I'll be sworn, if thou be
    Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipp'd
    might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair
    on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
  GOBBO. Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master
    agree? I have brought him a present. How 'gree you now?
  GOBBO. God bless your worship!
  GOBBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
  GOBBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
  GOBBO. His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are
    scarce cater-cousins-  
  GOBBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
    worship; and my suit is-
  GOBBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

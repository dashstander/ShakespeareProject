  THIRD MURTHERER. Macbeth.
  THIRD MURTHERER. Hark! I hear horses.
  THIRD MURTHERER. Almost a mile, but he does usually-  
    So all men do -from hence to the palace gate
    Make it their walk.
  THIRD MURTHERER. 'Tis he.
  THIRD MURTHERER. Who did strike out the light?
  THIRD MURTHERER. There's but one down; the son is fled.

  SECOND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,
    If Warwick be so near as men report.
  SECOND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
  SECOND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
    But to defend his person from night-foes?
             Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET,
                   and French soldiers, silent all
  SECOND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.
       WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and
      set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK
                   and the rest following them
      The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK  
         and the rest, bringing the KING out in his gown,
   sitting in a chair. GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage

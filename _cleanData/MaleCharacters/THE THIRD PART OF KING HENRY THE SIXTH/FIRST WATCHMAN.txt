  FIRST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
    The King by this is set him down to sleep.
  FIRST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
    Never to lie and take his natural rest
    Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
  FIRST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
  FIRST WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
  FIRST WATCHMAN. Who goes there?

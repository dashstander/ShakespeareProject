  FIRST KEEPER. Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,
    For through this laund anon the deer will come;
    And in this covert will we make our stand,
    Culling the principal of all the deer.
  FIRST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
    Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
    Here stand we both, and aim we at the best;
    And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
    I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
    In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
  FIRST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.
    This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him.
  FIRST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
  FIRST KEEPER. No;
    For we were subjects but while you were king.
  FIRST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.  
  FIRST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,
    To go with us unto the officers.

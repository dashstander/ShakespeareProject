  SECOND OUTLAW. If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
                  Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
  SECOND OUTLAW. Peace! we'll hear him.
  SECOND OUTLAW. Whither travel you?
  SECOND OUTLAW. For what offence?
  SECOND OUTLAW. Have you the tongues?
  SECOND OUTLAW. Tell us this: have you anything to take to?
  SECOND OUTLAW. And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
    Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
  SECOND OUTLAW. Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
    Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.
    Are you content to be our general-
    To make a virtue of necessity,
    And live as we do in this wilderness?
  SECOND OUTLAW. Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
  SECOND OUTLAW. Come, bring her away.
  SECOND OUTLAW. Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
    But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
    Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
    There is our captain; we'll follow him that's fled.
    The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

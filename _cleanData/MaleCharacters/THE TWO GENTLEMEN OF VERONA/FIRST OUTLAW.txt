  FIRST OUTLAW. Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
  FIRST OUTLAW. That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
  FIRST OUTLAW. Whence came you?
  FIRST OUTLAW. What, were you banish'd thence?
  FIRST OUTLAW. Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
    But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
  FIRST OUTLAW. We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
  FIRST OUTLAW. And I for such-like petty crimes as these.
    But to the purpose- for we cite our faults
    That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
    And, partly, seeing you are beautified  
    With goodly shape, and by your own report
    A linguist, and a man of such perfection
    As we do in our quality much want-
  FIRST OUTLAW. But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest.
  FIRST OUTLAW. Come, come.
    Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
  FIRST OUTLAW. Where is the gentleman that was with her?
  FIRST OUTLAW. Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave;
    Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
    And will not use a woman lawlessly.

  CICERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
    Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
  CICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  CICERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
    But men may construe things after their fashion,
    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
    Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?  
  CICERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
    Is not to walk in.

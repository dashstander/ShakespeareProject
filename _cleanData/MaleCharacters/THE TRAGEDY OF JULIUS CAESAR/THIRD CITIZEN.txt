  THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be Caesar.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair;
    We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
  THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus' sake,
    He finds himself beholding to us all.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, that's certain.
    We are blest that Rome is rid of him.  
  THIRD CITIZEN. Has he, masters?
    I fear there will a worse come in his place.
  THIRD CITIZEN. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
  THIRD CITIZEN. You shall have leave.
  THIRD CITIZEN. O woeful day!
  THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.
  THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!
  THIRD CITIZEN. Pluck down benches.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Where do you dwell?
  THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, and truly, you were best.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Your name, sir, truly.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho, firebrands. To
    Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and some  
    to Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go!             Exeunt.
ACT IV. SCENE I.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.

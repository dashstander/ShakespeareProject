  SECOND CITIZEN. I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,
    When severally we hear them rendered.
                               Exit Cassius, with some Citizens.
                                    Brutus goes into the pulpit.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a statue with his ancestors.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.  
  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.
  SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the matter,  
    Caesar has had great wrong.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
  SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murtherers. The will!
    Read the will!
  SECOND CITIZEN. Descend.
                                  He comes down from the pulpit.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
  SECOND CITIZEN. O noble Caesar!
  SECOND CITIZEN. We will be revenged.
  SECOND CITIZEN. We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with
    him.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Go fetch fire.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Answer every man directly.
  SECOND CITIZEN. That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.
    You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.
  SECOND CITIZEN. That matter is answered directly.

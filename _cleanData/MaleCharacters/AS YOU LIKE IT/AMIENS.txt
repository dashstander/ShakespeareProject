  AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,
    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
  AMIENS.    Under the greenwood tree
               Who loves to lie with me,
               And turn his merry note
               Unto the sweet bird's throat,
             Come hither, come hither, come hither.
               Here shall he see
               No enemy
             But winter and rough weather.
  AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
  AMIENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
  AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
  AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.
  AMIENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
    will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
    you.
  AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
  AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
  AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
                                                Exeunt severally

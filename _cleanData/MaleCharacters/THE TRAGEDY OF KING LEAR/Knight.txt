  Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
  Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.
  Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment
     your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious affection
     as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness appears
     as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also
     and your daughter.
  Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for
     my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.
  Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool
     hath much pined away.

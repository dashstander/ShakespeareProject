  Capt. I'll do't, my lord.
  Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
     If it be man's work, I'll do't.                       Exit.
          Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers.
  Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.
  
  Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did.
  Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord.

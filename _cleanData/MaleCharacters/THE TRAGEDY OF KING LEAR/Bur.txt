  Bur. Most royal Majesty,
     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,
     Nor will you tender less.
  Bur. I know no answer.
  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.
     Election makes not up on such conditions.
  Bur. Royal Lear,
     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
     Duchess of Burgundy.
  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father
     That you must lose a husband.

  GAOLER. For a worthy lady,
    And one who much I honour.
  GAOLER. I may not, madam;
    To the contrary I have express commandment.
  GAOLER. So please you, madam,
    To put apart these your attendants,
    Shall bring Emilia forth.
  GAOLER. And, madam,
    I must be present at your conference.
  GAOLER. Madam, if't please the Queen to send the babe,
    I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
    Having no warrant.
  GAOLER. I do believe it.

  SEBASTIAN. A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
    incharitable dog!
  SEBASTIAN. I am out of patience.
  SEBASTIAN. Let's take leave of him.
                                    Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
  SEBASTIAN. He receives comfort like cold porridge.
  SEBASTIAN. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by
    and by it will strike.
  SEBASTIAN. One-Tell.  
  SEBASTIAN. A dollar.
  SEBASTIAN. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
    should.
  SEBASTIAN. He will be talking.
  SEBASTIAN. The old cock.
  SEBASTIAN. Done. The wager?
  SEBASTIAN. A match!
  SEBASTIAN. So, you're paid.
  SEBASTIAN. Yet-
  SEBASTIAN. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
    deliver'd.
  SEBASTIAN. As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
  SEBASTIAN. Of that there's none, or little.
  SEBASTIAN. With an eye of green in't.  
  SEBASTIAN. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
  SEBASTIAN. As many vouch'd rarities are.
  SEBASTIAN. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
  SEBASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
    our return.
  SEBASTIAN. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?
    Good Lord, how you take it!
  SEBASTIAN. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
  SEBASTIAN. I think he will carry this island home in his
    pocket, and give it his son for an apple.
  SEBASTIAN. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
  SEBASTIAN. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
    That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
    But rather lose her to an African;
    Where she, at least, is banish'd from your eye,
    Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
  SEBASTIAN. You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise
    By all of us; and the fair soul herself
    Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
    Which end o' th' beam should bow. We have lost your son,
    I fear, for ever. Milan and Naples have
    Moe widows in them of this business' making,
    Than we bring men to comfort them;  
    The fault's your own.
  SEBASTIAN. Very well.
  SEBASTIAN. Foul weather?
  SEBASTIAN. Or docks, or mallows.
  SEBASTIAN. Scape being drunk for want of wine.
  SEBASTIAN. Yet he would be king on't.
  SEBASTIAN. No marrying 'mong his subjects?
  SEBASTIAN. Save his Majesty!
  SEBASTIAN. An it had not fall'n flat-long.
  SEBASTIAN. We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.  
  SEBASTIAN. Please you, sir,
    Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
    It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
    It is a comforter.
  SEBASTIAN. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
  SEBASTIAN. Why
    Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
    Myself dispos'd to sleep.
  SEBASTIAN. What, art thou waking?
  SEBASTIAN. I do; and surely
    It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st
    Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
    This is a strange repose, to be asleep
    With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
    And yet so fast asleep.
  SEBASTIAN. Thou dost snore distinctly;
    There's meaning in thy snores.
  SEBASTIAN. Well, I am standing water.
  SEBASTIAN. Do so: to ebb,
    Hereditary sloth instructs me.
  SEBASTIAN. Prithee say on.
    The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
    A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
    Which throes thee much to yield.
  SEBASTIAN. I have no hope
    That he's undrown'd.
  SEBASTIAN. He's gone.
  SEBASTIAN. Claribel.
  SEBASTIAN. What stuff is this! How say you?
    'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
    So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
    There is some space.
  SEBASTIAN. Methinks I do.
  SEBASTIAN. I remember
    You did supplant your brother Prospero.
  SEBASTIAN. But, for your conscience-
  SEBASTIAN. Thy case, dear friend,
    Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
    I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke
    Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
    And I the King shall love thee.
  SEBASTIAN. O, but one word.                  [They talk apart]  
          Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, with music and song
  SEBASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
    Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
    Like bulls, or rather lions; did't not wake you?
    It struck mine ear most terribly.
  SEBASTIAN.  [Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage  
    Will we take throughly.
  SEBASTIAN.  [Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night; no more.
           Solemn and strange music; and PROSPERO on the
           top, invisible. Enter several strange SHAPES,
           bringing in a banquet; and dance about it with
           gentle actions of salutations; and inviting the
           KING, etc., to eat, they depart
  SEBASTIAN. A living drollery. Now I will believe
    That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
    There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
    At this hour reigning-there.  
  SEBASTIAN. No matter, since
    They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
    Will't please you taste of what is here?
  SEBASTIAN. But one fiend at a time,  
    I'll fight their legions o'er.
  SEBASTIAN.  [Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
  SEBASTIAN. A most high miracle!
  SEBASTIAN. Ha, ha!
    What things are these, my lord Antonio?
    Will money buy'em?
  SEBASTIAN. He is drunk now; where had he wine?
  SEBASTIAN. Why, how now, Stephano!
  SEBASTIAN. Or stole it, rather.
                          Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO

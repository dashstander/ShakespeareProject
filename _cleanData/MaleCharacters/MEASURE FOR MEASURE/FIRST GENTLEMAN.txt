  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
    Hungary's!
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain

    There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before
    meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. What, in metre?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think, or in any religion.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt
    a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of
    an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French
    velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Judge.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, and more.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
    art full of error; I am sound.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. How now! which of your hips has the most profound
    sciatica?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Who's that, I pray thee?  
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.

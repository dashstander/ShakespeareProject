  TAILOR. You bid me make it orderly and well,
    According to the fashion and the time.
  TAILOR. She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
  TAILOR. Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
    Just as my master had direction.
    Grumio gave order how it should be done.
  TAILOR. But how did you desire it should be made?
  TAILOR. But did you not request to have it cut?
  TAILOR. I have.  
  TAILOR. Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
  TAILOR. This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou
    shouldst know it.

  MERCHANT. O, 'tis a worthy lord!
  MERCHANT. A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,
    To an untirable and continuate goodness.
    He passes.
  MERCHANT. O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?
  MERCHANT. [Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.
  MERCHANT. No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
    Which all men speak with him.
  MERCHANT. He'll spare none.
  MERCHANT. Ay, Apemantus.  
  MERCHANT. If traffic do it, the gods do it.

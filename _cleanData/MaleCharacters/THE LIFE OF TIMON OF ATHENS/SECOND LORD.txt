  SECOND LORD. Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
  SECOND LORD. Fare thee well, fare thee well.
  SECOND LORD. Why, Apemantus?
  SECOND LORD. Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence.
  SECOND LORD. He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,
    Is but his steward; no meed but he repays
    Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
    But breeds the giver a return exceeding
    All use of quittance.
  SECOND LORD. Long may he live in fortunes! shall we in?
  SECOND LORD. Let it flow this way, my good lord.
  SECOND LORD. Joy had the like conception in our eyes,
    And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
  SECOND LORD. Our horses!
               Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket
  SECOND LORD. With more than common thanks I will receive it.
  SECOND LORD. So infinitely endear'd-
  SECOND LORD. I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
    did but try us this other day.
  SECOND LORD. It should not be, by the persuasion of his new
    feasting.
  SECOND LORD. In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
    business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he
    sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.
  SECOND LORD. Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
    you?
  SECOND LORD. A thousand pieces!
  SECOND LORD. He sent to me, sir- here he comes.
                   Enter TIMON and attendants
  SECOND LORD. The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
    your lordship.
  SECOND LORD. My noble lord-
  SECOND LORD. My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame that,
    when your lordship this other day sent to me, I was so
    unfortunate a beggar.
  SECOND LORD. If you had sent but two hours before-
  SECOND LORD. All cover'd dishes!
  SECOND LORD. I pray you, upon what?
  SECOND LORD. This is the old man still.
  SECOND LORD. It does; but time will- and so-
  SECOND LORD. Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
  SECOND LORD. Here 'tis.
  SECOND LORD. Lord Timon's mad.

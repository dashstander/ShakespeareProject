  FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
    of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out,
    air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
  FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
    hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
  FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
    added to your having, gave you some ground.
  FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
    not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection
    of her wit.
  FIRST LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
  FIRST LORD. What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your
    bowl.
  FIRST LORD. Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court
    to-night?
  FIRST LORD. There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of
    Leonatus' friends.
  FIRST LORD. One of your lordship's pages.
  FIRST LORD. Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most
    coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
  FIRST LORD. But not every man patient after the noble temper of
    your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
  FIRST LORD. Day, my lord.

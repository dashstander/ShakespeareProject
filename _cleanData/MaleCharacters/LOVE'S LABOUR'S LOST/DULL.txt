  DULL. Which is the Duke's own person?
  DULL. I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's
    farborough; but I would see his own person in flesh and blood.
  DULL. Signior Arme- Arme- commends you. There's villainy abroad;
    this letter will tell you more.
  DULL. Me, an't shall please you; I am Antony Dull.
  DULL. Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and
    you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a
    must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at
    the park; she is allow'd for the day-woman. Fare you well.
  DULL. Come, Jaquenetta, away.             Exit with JAQUENETTA
  DULL. 'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  DULL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
  DULL. You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
    What was a month old at Cain's birth that's not five weeks old as
      yet?  
  DULL. What is Dictynna?
  DULL. 'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
  DULL. And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is
    never but a month old; and I say, beside, that 'twas a pricket
    that the Princess kill'd.
  DULL. [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a
    talent.
  DULL. Nor understood none neither, sir.
  DULL. I'll make one in a dance, or so, or I will play
    On the tabor to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

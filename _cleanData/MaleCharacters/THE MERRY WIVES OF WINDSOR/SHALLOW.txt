  SHALLOW. Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star
    Chamber matter of it; if he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs,
    he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.
  SHALLOW. Ay, cousin Slender, and Custalorum.
  SHALLOW. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
    hundred years.
  SHALLOW. It is an old coat.
  SHALLOW. The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old
    coat.
  SHALLOW. You may, by marrying.
  SHALLOW. Not a whit.
  SHALLOW. The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.
  SHALLOW. Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword  
    should end it.
  SHALLOW. Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
  SHALLOW. I know the young gentlewoman; she has good
    gifts.
  SHALLOW. Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff
    there?
  SHALLOW. Master Page, I am glad to see you; much good do
    it your good heart! I wish'd your venison better; it was ill  
    kill'd. How doth good Mistress Page?-and I thank you
    always with my heart, la! with my heart.
  SHALLOW. Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
  SHALLOW. That he will not. 'Tis your fault; 'tis your fault;
    'tis a good dog.
  SHALLOW. Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog. Can there be
    more said? He is good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?
  SHALLOW. He hath wrong'd me, Master Page.
  SHALLOW. If it be confessed, it is not redressed; is not that  
    so, Master Page? He hath wrong'd me; indeed he hath; at a
    word, he hath, believe me; Robert Shallow, esquire, saith
    he is wronged.
  SHALLOW. Knight, you have beaten my men, kill'd my deer,
    and broke open my lodge.
  SHALLOW. Tut, a pin! this shall be answer'd.
  SHALLOW. The Council shall know this.
  SHALLOW. Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word
    with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
    tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do
    you understand me?
  SHALLOW. Nay, but understand me.
  SHALLOW. Ay, there's the point, sir.
  SHALLOW. Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
  SHALLOW. That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,
    marry her?
  SHALLOW. Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what
    I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
  SHALLOW. Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
  SHALLOW. Here comes fair Mistress Anne. Would I were
    young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
  SHALLOW. I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne!
  SHALLOW. I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
    twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with
    us? We have sport in hand.
  SHALLOW. Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
    the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.  
  SHALLOW.  [To PAGE] Will you go with us to behold it? My
    merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and,
    I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe
    me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you
    what our sport shall be.               [They converse apart]
  SHALLOW. Have with you, mine host.
  SHALLOW. Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these
    times you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
    I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,  
    'tis here. I have seen the time with my long sword I would
    have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
  SHALLOW. Save you, Master Doctor Caius!
  SHALLOW. He is the wiser man, Master Doctor: he is a curer  
    of souls, and you a curer of bodies; if you should fight,
    you go against the hair of your professions. Is it not true,
    Master Page?
  SHALLOW. Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old, and
    of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to make
    one. Though we are justices, and doctors, and churchmen,
    Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us; we are
    the sons of women, Master Page.
  SHALLOW. It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
  CAIUS, I come to fetch you home. I am sworn of the peace;
    you have show'd yourself a wise physician, and Sir Hugh
    hath shown himself a wise and patient churchman. You
    must go with me, Master Doctor.
  SHALLOW.  [Aside]  We will do it.
  PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER. Adieu, good Master Doctor.
                               Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER
  SHALLOW. How now, Master Parson! Good morrow, good
    Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student
     from his book, and it is wonderful.
  SHALLOW. What, the sword and the word! Do you study
    them both, Master Parson?
  SHALLOW. I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
    heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning, so wide of
    his own respect.
  SHALLOW. It appears so, by his weapons. Keep them asunder;
    here comes Doctor Caius.
                 Enter HOST, CAIUS, and RUGBY
  SHALLOW. So do you, good Master Doctor.
  SHALLOW. Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.
  SHALLOW. I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
  SHALLOW. We have linger'd about a match between Anne
    Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have
    our answer.
  SHALLOW. Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer
    wooing at Master Page's.          Exeunt SHALLOW and SLENDER
  SHALLOW. Break their talk, Mistress Quickly; my kinsman
    shall speak for himself.
  SHALLOW. Be not dismay'd.
  SHALLOW. She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a
    father!
  SHALLOW. Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
  SHALLOW. He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
  SHALLOW. He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds
    jointure.
  SHALLOW. Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that
    good comfort. She calls you, coz; I'll leave you.
  SHALLOW. Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
  SHALLOW. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
    wrongs you.
  SHALLOW. That's good too; but what needs either your mum
    or her budget? The white will decipher her well enough.
    It hath struck ten o'clock.

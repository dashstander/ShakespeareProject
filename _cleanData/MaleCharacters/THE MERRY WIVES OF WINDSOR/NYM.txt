  NYM. Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour.
  NYM. Be avis'd, sir, and pass good humours; I will say
    'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's humour on  
    me; that is the very note of it.
  NYM. He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?
  NYM. The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
  NYM. The anchor is deep; will that humour pass?
  NYM. The humour rises; it is good; humour me the angels.
  NYM. I thank thee for that humour.
  NYM. I will run no base humour. Here, take the
    humour-letter; I will keep the haviour of reputation.
  NYM. I have operations in my head which be humours of
    revenge.
  NYM. By welkin and her star!
  NYM. With both the humours, I.
    I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
  NYM. My humour shall not cool; I will incense Page to deal
    with poison; I will possess him with yellowness; for the  
    revolt of mine is dangerous. That is my true humour.
  NYM.  [To PAGE]  And this is true; I like not the humour of
    lying. He hath wronged me in some humours; I should
    have borne the humour'd letter to her; but I have a sword,
    and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves your wife;
    there's the short and the long.
    My name is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch;
    'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
    Adieu! I love not the humour of bread and cheese; and
    there's the humour of it. Adieu.                    Exit Nym

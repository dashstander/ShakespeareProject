  SIMPLE. Book of Riddles! Why, did you not lend it to Alice
    Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore
    Michaelmas?
  SIMPLE. Well, sir.
  SIMPLE. Ay, for fault of a better.
  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth.  
  SIMPLE. No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a
    little yellow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard.
  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as
    any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a
    warrener.
  SIMPLE. Yes, indeed, does he.
  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth, to desire her to-  
  SIMPLE. To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
    speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master,
    in the way of marriage.
  SIMPLE.  [Aside to QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to come
    under one body's hand.
  SIMPLE. Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward; every
    way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town way.
  SIMPLE. I will, Sir.                                      Exit
  SIMPLE. Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh.
  SIMPLE. No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
    Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over the
    stile, this way.
  SIMPLE. Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
    from Master Slender.
  SIMPLE. There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into
    his chamber; I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down;
    I come to speak with her, indeed.
  SIMPLE. Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
    Brainford?
  SIMPLE. My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her,
    seeing her go thorough the streets, to know, sir, whether one
    Nym, sir, that beguil'd him of a chain, had the chain or no.
  SIMPLE. And what says she, I pray, sir?
  FALSTAFF Marry, she says that the very same man that
    beguil'd Master Slender of his chain cozen'd him of it.
  SIMPLE. I would I could have spoken with the woman
    herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too,  
    from him.
  SIMPLE. I would I could have spoken with the woman
    herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too,  
    from him.
  SIMPLE. I may not conceal them, sir.
  SIMPLE. What sir?
  SIMPLE. May I be bold to say so, sir?
  SIMPLE., I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad
    with these tidings.                              Exit SIMPLE

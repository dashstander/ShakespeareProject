  BARDOLPH. You Banbury cheese!
  BARDOLPH. Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had
    drunk himself out of his five sentences.
  BARDOLPH. And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd;
    and so conclusions pass'd the careers.
  BARDOLPH. It is a life that I have desir'd; I will thrive.
  BARDOLPH. Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would
    fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
    sent your worship a moming's draught of sack.
  BARDOLPH. Ay, sir.
  BARDOLPH. Here, sir.
  BARDOLPH. Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you
  BARDOLPH. Come in, woman.
                     Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
  BARDOLPH. With eggs, sir?
  BARDOLPH. Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
    horses; the Duke himself will be to-morrow at court, and
    they are going to meet him.
  BARDOLPH. Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
  BARDOLPH. Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!
  BARDOLPH. Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I
    came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
    them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like
    three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.

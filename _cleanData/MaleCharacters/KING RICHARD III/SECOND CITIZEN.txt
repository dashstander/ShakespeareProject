  SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
    Hear you the news abroad?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
    better.
    I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.
                        Enter another CITIZEN
  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!  
  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,
    Which, in his nonage, council under him,
    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
    You cannot reason almost with a man
    That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.

  FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the
    warrant,
    That we may be admitted where he is.
  FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
    prate;
    Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
    We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
  FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt
SCENE 4.
London. The Tower
Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER
  FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?
  FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came
    hither on my legs.
  FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
    you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
  FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
    he wakes.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
    sleeping.
  FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?
  FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.
  FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
    tell him so.
  FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?
    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
    are yet within me.
  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's
    done.
  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's
    done.
  FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?
  FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our
    reward, thy conscience flies out.
  FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?
  FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
    persuading me not to kill the Duke.
  FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
    me.
  FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of
    thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
    next room.
  FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.
  FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.
  FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.
  FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks
    mine own.
  FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.
  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
  FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God
    Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
    Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
  FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
    to us,
    When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
  FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister
    When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
    That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?  
  FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
    faults,
    Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.
  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
  FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
    deceive yourself:
    'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
    CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
    And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
    That he would labour my delivery.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
    From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
    From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
  FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
  FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
    this will not do,
    I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
                                              Exit with the body
  FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
    Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
    Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
    And when I have my meed, I will away;
    For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit

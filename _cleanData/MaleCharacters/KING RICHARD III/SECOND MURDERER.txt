  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
    him see our commission and talk no more.
                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]
  SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
  SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great
    judgment-day.
  SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath  
    bred a kind of remorse in me.
  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
    be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
    defend me.
  SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.
  SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
    hold me but while one tells twenty.
  SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
  SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!  
  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
    none will entertain it.
  SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
    coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
    cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
    neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
    fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
    that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
    It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
    to himself and live without it.
  SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe
    him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
    sigh.  
  SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
  SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of
    him.
  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!
  SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,
    anon.
  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.
  SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-
  SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
  SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our
    King.
  SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl
    on thee
    For false forswearing, and for murder too;
    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
    In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.  
  SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
    defend.
  SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
    hates you.
  SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,
    my lord.
  SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?
  SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.
  SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately
    dispatch'd!
    How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
    Of this most grievous murder!  
                       Re-enter FIRST MURDERER
  FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou
    help'st me not?
    By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
    been!
  SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his
    brother!
    Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
    For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit

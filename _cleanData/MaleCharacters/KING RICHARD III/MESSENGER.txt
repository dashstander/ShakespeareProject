  MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
  MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.
  MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
    Are sent to Pomfret, and with them
    Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
  MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
  MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
    Why or for what the nobles were committed  
    Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.
  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.
                        Enter LORD HASTINGS
  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.
    First, he commends him to your noble self.
  MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night
    He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
    Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
    And that may be determin'd at the one  
    Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
    Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure-
    If you will presently take horse with him
    And with all speed post with him toward the north
    To shun the danger that his soul divines.
  MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
 Exit
                         Enter CATESBY
  MESSENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
    As I by friends am well advertised,
    Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,
    Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,
    With many moe confederates, are in arms.
                         Enter another MESSENGER
  MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.

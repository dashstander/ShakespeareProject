  BARDOLPH. Well met, Corporal Nym.
  BARDOLPH. What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
  BARDOLPH. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we'll
    be all three sworn brothers to France. Let't be so, good Corporal
    Nym.
  BARDOLPH. It is certain, Corporal, that he is married to Nell
    Quickly; and certainly she did you wrong, for you were
    troth-plight to her.  
  BARDOLPH. Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good Corporal, be
    patient here.
  BARDOLPH. Good Lieutenant, good Corporal, offer nothing here.
  BARDOLPH. Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first
    stroke I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
                                                         [Draws]
  BARDOLPH. Away, you rogue.
  BARDOLPH. Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France
    together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one
    another's throats?
  BARDOLPH. By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill  
    him; by this sword, I will.
  BARDOLPH. Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends; an
    thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me too. Prithee put up.
  BARDOLPH. Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
    heaven or in hell!
  BARDOLPH. And of women.
  BARDOLPH. Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's
    all the riches I got in his service.  
  BARDOLPH. Farewell, hostess.                     [Kissing her]
  BARDOLPH. On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!

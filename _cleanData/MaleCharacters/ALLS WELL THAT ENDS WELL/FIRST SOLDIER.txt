  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
  FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.
  FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy
    tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
    seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;
    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
    Something to save thy life.  
  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.
    Come on; thou art granted space.
                   Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within
  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
    'em?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.  
  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you
    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is
    strong.' What say you to that?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.'
    What say you to that?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him
    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say
    you to this? What do you know of it?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
    camp?
  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?
  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
    gold.'
  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
    'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he never pays the score.
    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.
    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
    For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
                                                   PAROLLES.'
  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
    fain to hang you.
  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to
    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
    honesty?
  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?
  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
    the Florentine?
  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his
    pleasure.
  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.
    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the  
    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
    you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.
  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your
    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that
    has a knot on 't yet.
  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were
    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent  
    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of
    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS

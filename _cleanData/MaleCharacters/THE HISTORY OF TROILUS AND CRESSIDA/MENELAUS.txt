  MENELAUS. From Troy.
  
                      Enter AENEAS
  MENELAUS. How do you? How do you?                              Exit
  MENELAUS. I had good argument for kissing once.
  MENELAUS. O, this is trim!
  MENELAUS. I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
  MENELAUS. I'll give you boot; I'll give you three for one.
  MENELAUS. An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.
  MENELAUS. You fillip me o' th' head.
  MENELAUS. Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting.
    You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
  MENELAUS. Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  MENELAUS. Good night, my lord.

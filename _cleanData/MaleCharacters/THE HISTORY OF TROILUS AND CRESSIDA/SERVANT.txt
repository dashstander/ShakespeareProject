  SERVANT. Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
  SERVANT. Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
  SERVANT. The lord be praised!
  SERVANT. Faith, sir, superficially.
  SERVANT. I hope I shall know your honour better.
  SERVANT. You are in the state of grace.
  SERVANT. I do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.  
  SERVANT. Wholly, sir.
  SERVANT. To the hearers, sir.
  SERVANT. At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
  SERVANT. Who shall I command, sir?
  SERVANT. That's to't, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of
    Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the mortal Venus,
    the heart-blood of beauty, love's invisible soul-
  SERVANT. No, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her
    attributes?
  SERVANT. Sodden business! There's a stew'd phrase indeed!
              Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended
  SERVANT. I go, my lord.                                        Exit
                       Enter AGAMEMNON

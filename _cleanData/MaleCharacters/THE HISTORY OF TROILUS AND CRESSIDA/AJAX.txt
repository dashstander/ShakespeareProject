  AJAX. Thersites!
  AJAX. Thersites!
  AJAX. Dog!
  AJAX. Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear? Feel, then.
                                                        [Strikes him]
  AJAX. Speak, then, thou whinid'st leaven, speak. I will beat thee
    into handsomeness.
  AJAX. Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
  AJAX. The proclamation!
  AJAX. Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.
  AJAX. I say, the proclamation.
  AJAX. Mistress Thersites!
  AJAX. Cobloaf!
  AJAX. You whoreson cur!                               [Strikes him]  
  AJAX. Thou stool for a witch!
  AJAX. You dog!
  AJAX. You cur!                                        [Strikes him]
  AJAX. Therefore I beat thee.
  AJAX. O thou damned cur! I shall-
  AJAX. I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the
    proclamation, and he rails upon me.
  AJAX. Well, go to, go to.
  AJAX. I shall cut out your tongue.
  AJAX. Farewell. Who shall answer him?
  AJAX. O, meaning you! I will go learn more of it.            Exeunt
ACT II. SCENE 2.
Troy. PRIAM'S palace
Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS
  AJAX. Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it
    melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my head, 'tis
    pride. But why, why? Let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.
                                              [Takes AGAMEMNON aside]
  AJAX. What is he more than another?
  AJAX. Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better
    man than I am?
  AJAX. Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?
  AJAX. Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not
    what pride is.
  AJAX. I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.
  AJAX. If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the
    face.
  AJAX. An 'a be proud with me I'll pheeze his pride.
    Let me go to him.
  AJAX. A paltry, insolent fellow!
  AJAX. Can he not be sociable?
  AJAX. I'll let his humours blood.
  AJAX. An all men were a my mind-
  AJAX. 'A should not bear it so, 'a should eat's words first.
    Shall pride carry it?
  AJAX. I will knead him, I'll make him supple.
  AJAX. A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!  
    Would he were a Troyan!
  AJAX. Shall I call you father?
  AJAX. How now, Patroclus?
  AJAX. Ha?
  AJAX. Ay, and good next day too.                               Exit
  AJAX. Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
    Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe;
    Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
    Out-swell the colic of puff Aquilon'd.
    Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood:
    Thou blowest for Hector.                         [Trumpet sounds]
  AJAX. I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
  AJAX. I thank thee, Hector.
    Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
    I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
    A great addition earned in thy death.
  AJAX. If I might in entreaties find success,
    As seld I have the chance, I would desire
    My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
  AJAX. Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
  AJAX. Do not chafe thee, cousin;
    And you, Achilles, let these threats alone
    Till accident or purpose bring you to't.
    You may have every day enough of Hector,
    If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
    Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
  AJAX. No, yonder 'tis;
    There, where we see the lights.
  AJAX. No, not a whit.
                    Re-enter ACHILLES
  AJAX. Troilus! thou coward Troilus!                            Exit
  AJAX. Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head.
                     Enter DIOMEDES
  AJAX. What wouldst thou?
  AJAX. Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
    Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!
                      Enter TROILUS
  AJAX. I'll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed.
  AJAX. If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
    Great Hector was as good a man as he.

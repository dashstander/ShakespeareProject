  ROSS. My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
    Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.
  ROSS. No good at all that I can do for him;
    Unless you call it good to pity him,
    Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
  ROSS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;
    And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find
    For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.
  ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
  ROSS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,
    His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,
    But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke.
  ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
    And unavoided is the danger now
    For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
  ROSS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland.
    We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,
    Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore be bold.
  ROSS. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.
  ROSS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
  ROSS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.

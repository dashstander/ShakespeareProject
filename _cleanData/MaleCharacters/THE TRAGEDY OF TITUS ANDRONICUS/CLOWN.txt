  CLOWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down
    again, for the man must not be hang'd till the next week.
  CLOWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all
    my life.
  CLOWN. Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
  CLOWN. From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
    should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am
    going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs, to take up a matter
    of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal's men.  
  CLOWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
  CLOWN. Ay, sir.
  CLOWN. I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
  CLOWN. God be with you, sir; I will.
  CLOWN. Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.
  CLOWN. 'Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden. I have
    brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
                                   [SATURNINUS reads the letter]
  CLOWN. How much money must I have?
  CLOWN. Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair
    end.                                          [Exit guarded]

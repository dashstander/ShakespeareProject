  Con. What the goodyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure
    sad?
  Con. You should hear reason.
  Con. If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
  Con. Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may
    do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against
    your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where  
    it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
    weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the
    season for your own harvest.
  Con. Can you make no use of your discontent?
  Con. To the death, my lord.
  Con. Here, man. I am at thy elbow.
  Con. I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy
    tale.
  Con. Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
  Con. I wonder at it.
  Con. Yes, it is apparel.
  Con. Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
  Con. No; 'twas the vane on the house.
  Con. All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears out more
    apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the
    fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling
    me of the fashion?
  Con. And thought they Margaret was Hero?
  Con. Masters, masters--
  1. Watch. You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
  Con. Masters--
  2. Watch. Never speak, we charge you. Let us obey you to go with
    us.
  Con. Masters--
  2. Watch. Never speak, we charge you. Let us obey you to go with
    us.
  Con. A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
                                                         Exeunt.
Scene IV.
A Room in Leonato's house.
Enter Hero, and Margaret and Ursula.
  Con. I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
  Con. Marry, sir, we say we are none.
  Con. Off, coxcomb!
  Con. Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.

  SIMPCOX. Born blind, an't please your Grace.
  SIMPCOX. At Berwick in the north, an't like your Grace.
  SIMPCOX. God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
    A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
    By good Saint Alban, who said 'Simpcox, come,
    Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
  SIMPCOX. Ay, God Almighty help me!
  SIMPCOX. A fall off of a tree.  
  SIMPCOX. O, born so, master!
  SIMPCOX. But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
  SIMPCOX. Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
    And made me climb, With danger of my life.
  SIMPCOX. Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.
  SIMPCOX. Red, master; red as blood.
  SIMPCOX. Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.
  SIMPCOX. Alas, master, I know not.
  SIMPCOX. I know not.
  SIMPCOX. No, indeed, master.
  SIMPCOX. Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
  SIMPCOX. O master, that you could!
  SIMPCOX. Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone!
    You go about to torture me in vain.
                         Enter a BEADLE with whips
  SIMPCOX. Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
           After the BEADLE hath hit him once, he leaps over
           the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry
                             'A miracle!'

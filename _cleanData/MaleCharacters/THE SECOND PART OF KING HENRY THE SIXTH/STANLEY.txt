  STANLEY. So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace.
  STANLEY. Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
    There to be us'd according to your state.
  STANLEY. Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey's lady;
    According to that state you shall be us'd.
  STANLEY. Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
    And go we to attire you for our journey.

  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus
    Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.
  MENAS. I cannot hope
    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
    Not mov'd by Antony.
  MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
    treaty.- You and I have known, sir.
  MENAS. We have, sir.
  MENAS. And you by land.
  MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.
  MENAS. And you by land.
  MENAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
    Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
  MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
    you, is he married to Cleopatra?
  MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  MENAS. Pray ye, sir?
  MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
    than the love of the parties.
  MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?
  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
    health for you.
  MENAS. Come, let's away.                                Exeunt

                           SCENE VII.
             On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum
     Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet
  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
      Captain,
    And hear me speak a word.
  MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
      me,
    Rise from thy stool.
  MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  MENAS. But entertain it,  
    And though you think me poor, I am the man
    Will give thee all the world.
  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
    Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;
    Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
    Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
  MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors,
    Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
    And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
    All there is thine.
  MENAS. [Aside] For this,
    I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
    Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
    Shall never find it more.
  MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!
  MENAS. Why?
  MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
    That it might go on wheels!
  MENAS. Come.
  MENAS. No, to my cabin.
    These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
    Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
    To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!
                                  [Sound a flourish, with drums]
  MENAS. Hoo! Noble Captain, come.                        Exeunt

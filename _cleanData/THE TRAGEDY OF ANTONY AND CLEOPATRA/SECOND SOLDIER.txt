  SECOND SOLDIER. It will determine one way. Fare you well.
    Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  SECOND SOLDIER. Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
  SECOND SOLDIER. Soldiers, have careful watch.
  SECOND SOLDIER. Here we. And if to-morrow
    Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
    Our landmen will stand up.
  SECOND SOLDIER. Peace, what noise?
  SECOND SOLDIER. Hark!
  SECOND SOLDIER. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
    Now leaves him.
  SECOND SOLDIER. How now, masters!

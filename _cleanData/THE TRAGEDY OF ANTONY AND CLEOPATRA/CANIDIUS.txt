  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?
  CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
    Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
    Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
    And so should you.
  CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
    Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
    And we are women's men.
  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
    Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
    Carries beyond belief.
  CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
  CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.
                        Enter a MESSENGER
  CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth
    Each minute some.                                     Exeunt
ACT_3|SC_8
                          SCENE VIII.
                      A plain near Actium
             Enter CAESAR, with his army, marching
  CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
    And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
    O, he has given example for our flight
    Most grossly by his own!
  CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
  CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render
    My legions and my horse; six kings already
    Show me the way of yielding.

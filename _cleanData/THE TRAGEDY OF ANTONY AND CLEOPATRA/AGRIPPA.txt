  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
    Is now a widower.
  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,  
    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
    No worse a husband than the best of men;
    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
    That which none else can utter. By this marriage
    All little jealousies, which now seem great,
    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
    Would each to other, and all loves to both,
    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
    By duty ruminated.
  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
    her.
  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  AGRIPPA. Royal wench!
    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
  AGRIPPA. Let us go.
    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
    Whilst you abide here.
  AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
    Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
  AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?
  AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
  AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
  AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
  AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
  AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
  AGRIPPA. Both he loves.
  AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
           Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
  AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
  AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence
    Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
  AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?
  AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
  AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.
  AGRIPPA. Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit
  AGRIPPA. Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
    Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
    Exceeds what we expected.                             Exeunt
          Alarums. Enter ANTONY, and SCARUS wounded
  AGRIPPA. And strange it is
    That nature must compel us to lament
    Our most persisted deeds.
  AGRIPPA. A rarer spirit never
    Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us
    Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.

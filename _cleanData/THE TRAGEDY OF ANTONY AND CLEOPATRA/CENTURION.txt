  CENTURION. If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
    We must return to th' court of guard. The night
    Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
    By th' second hour i' th' morn.
  CENTURION. Enobarbus?
  CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
    May concern Caesar.
  CENTURION. Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
    Was never yet for sleep.
  CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him.
    [Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums
    Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
    To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
    Is fully out.

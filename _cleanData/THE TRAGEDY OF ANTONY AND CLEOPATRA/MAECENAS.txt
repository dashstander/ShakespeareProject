  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
    Were to remember that the present need
    Speaks to atone you.
  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.  
  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
    twelve persons there. Is this true?
  MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
    The heart of Antony, Octavia is
    A blessed lottery to him.
  MAECENAS. We shall,
    As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
    Before you, Lepidus.
  MAECENAS. This in the public eye?
  MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus
    Inform'd.
  MAECENAS. He'll never yield to that.
  MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.
    Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
    Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
    In his abominations, turns you off,
    And gives his potent regiment to a trull
    That noises it against us.
  MAECENAS. Caesar must think
    When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
    Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
    Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
    Made good guard for itself.
  MAECENAS. His taints and honours
    Wag'd equal with him.
  MAECENAS. When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
    He needs must see himself.

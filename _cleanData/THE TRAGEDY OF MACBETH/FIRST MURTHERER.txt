  FIRST MURTHERER. It was, so please your Highness.
  FIRST MURTHERER. You made it known to us.
  FIRST MURTHERER. We are men, my liege.
  FIRST MURTHERER. And I another
    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
    That I would set my life on any chance,
    To mend it or be rid on't.
  FIRST MURTHERER. Though our lives-
  FIRST MURTHERER. But who did bid thee join with us?
  FIRST MURTHERER. Then stand with us.
    The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;
    Now spurs the lated traveler apace
    To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
    The subject of our watch.
  FIRST MURTHERER. His horses go about.
  FIRST MURTHERER. Stand to't.
  FIRST MURTHERER. Let it come down.
                                           They set upon Banquo.
  FIRST MURTHERER. Wast not the way?
  FIRST MURTHERER. Well, let's away and say how much is done.
                                                         Exeunt.
SCENE IV.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.
  FIRST MURTHERER. Where is your husband?
  FIRST MURTHERER. He's a traitor.
  FIRST MURTHERER. What, you egg!
                                                      Stabs him.
    Young fry of treachery!

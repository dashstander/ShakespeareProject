  SECOND MURTHERER. I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.
  SECOND MURTHERER. We shall, my lord,
    Perform what you command us.
  SECOND MURTHERER. He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
    Our offices and what we have to do
    To the direction just.
  SECOND MURTHERER. Then 'tis he; the rest
    That are within the note of expectation
    Already are i' the court.
  SECOND MURTHERER. A light, a light!
              Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.
  SECOND MURTHERER. We have lost
    Best half of our affair.

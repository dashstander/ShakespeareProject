  SECOND SERVANT.Where's Cotus? My master calls for him.
    Cotus!                                                  Exit
                       Enter CORIOLANUS
  SECOND SERVANT. Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
    head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out.
  SECOND SERVANT. Away? Get you away.
  SECOND SERVANT. Are you so brave? I'll have you talk'd with anon.
          Enter a third SERVINGMAN. The first meets him
  SECOND SERVANT. And I shall.                              Exit
  SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for
    disturbing the lords within.
  SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
    of him.
  SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
    him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to
    term it.
  SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest
    man i' th' world.
  SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master?
  SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him.
  SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that;
    for the defence of a town our general is excellent.
  SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too
    hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.
  SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally given, he might have
    broil'd and eaten him too.
  SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
  SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
    This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and
    breed ballad-makers.
  SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be
    a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
    cuckolds.

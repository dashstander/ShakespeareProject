  FIRST SERVANT. Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our
    fellows are asleep.                                     Exit
                     Enter another SERVINGMAN
  FIRST SERVANT. What would you have, friend?
    Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door.  
 Exit
  FIRST SERVANT. A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him
    out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.
  FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration!
  FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his  
    finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
  FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,
    but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
  FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot
    on.
  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no matter for that.
  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the
    greater soldier.
  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too.
                       Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN  
  FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our general'?
  FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
    on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
    carbonado.
  FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news!
  FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that?
  FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward?
  FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
    day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.
    Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy,
    insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a
    destroyer of men.
  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

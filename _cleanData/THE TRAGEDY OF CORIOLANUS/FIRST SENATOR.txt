  FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:
    The Volsces are in arms.
  FIRST SENATOR. Then, worthy Marcius,
    Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
  FIRST SENATOR. Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know,
    Our greatest friends attend us.
  FIRST SENATOR.  [To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.
  FIRST SENATOR. So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
    That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
    And know how we proceed.
  FIRST SENATOR. Our army's in the field;
    We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
    To answer us.
  FIRST SENATOR. Farewell.
  FIRST SENATOR. No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
    That's lesser than a little.  [Drum afar off]  Hark, our drums
    Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
    Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
    Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
    They'll open of themselves.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!
    There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
    Amongst your cloven army.
  FIRST SENATOR. Speak, good Cominius.
    Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
    Rather our state's defective for requital
    Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people,
    We do request your kindest ears; and, after,  
    Your loving motion toward the common body,
    To yield what passes here.
  FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear
    What you have nobly done.
  FIRST SENATOR. He cannot but with measure fit the honours
    Which we devise him.
  FIRST SENATOR. Call Coriolanus.
    OFFICER. He doth appear.
                            Re-enter CORIOLANUS
  FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.
  FIRST SENATOR. Not in this heat, sir, now.
  FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we beseech you.
  FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
  FIRST SENATOR. The gods forbid!
    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
    Leave us to cure this cause.
  FIRST SENATOR. Noble Tribunes,
    It is the humane way; the other course
    Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
    Unknown to the beginning.
  FIRST SENATOR. Pray you let's to him.                   Exeunt
SCENE II.
Rome. The house of CORIOLANUS
Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES
  FIRST SENATOR. There's no remedy,
    Unless, by not so doing, our good city
    Cleave in the midst and perish.
  FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen!
  FIRST SENATOR. Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
    Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
    And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.
    Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
    Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;

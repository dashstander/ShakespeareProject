  ROMAN. I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I think,
    is Adrian.
  ROMAN. I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em.
    Know you me yet?
  ROMAN. The same, sir.
  ROMAN. There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people
    against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
  ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make  
    it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment
    of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
    all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes
    for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature
    for the violent breaking out.
  ROMAN. Banish'd, sir.
  ROMAN. The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the
    fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out
    with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in
    these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no
    request of his country.
  ROMAN. I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things
    from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you
    an army ready, say you?
  ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I
    think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily
    well met, and most glad of your company.
  ROMAN. Well, let us go together.

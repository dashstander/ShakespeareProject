  SICINIUS. Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
  SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the people-  
  SICINIUS. Nay, but his taunts!
  SICINIUS. Bemock the modest moon.
  SICINIUS. Such a nature,
    Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
    Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
    His insolence can brook to be commanded
    Under Cominius.
  SICINIUS. Besides, if things go well,  
    Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
    Of his demerits rob Cominius.
  SICINIUS. Let's hence and hear
    How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
    More than his singularity, he goes
    Upon this present action.
  SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
  SICINIUS. The lamb.
  SICINIUS. Especially in pride.
  SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known well enough too.
  SICINIUS. On the sudden
    I warrant him consul.
  SICINIUS. He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
    From where he should begin and end, but will
    Lose those he hath won.
  SICINIUS. Doubt not
    The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
    Upon their ancient malice will forget
    With the least cause these his new honours; which
    That he will give them make I as little question
    As he is proud to do't.  
  SICINIUS. 'Tis right.
  SICINIUS. I wish no better
    Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
    In execution.
  SICINIUS. It shall be to him then as our good wills:
    A sure destruction.
  SICINIUS. This, as you say, suggested
    At some time when his soaring insolence
    Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
    If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
    As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
    To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
    Shall darken him for ever.
                           Enter A MESSENGER
  SICINIUS. Have with you.                                Exeunt
SCENE II.
Rome. The Capitol
Enter two OFFICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol
  SICINIUS. We are convented
    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
    Inclinable to honour and advance
    The theme of our assembly.
  SICINIUS. Sir, the people
    Must have their voices; neither will they bate
    One jot of ceremony.
  SICINIUS. May they perceive's intent! He will require them
    As if he did contemn what he requested
    Should be in them to give.
  SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd.
    The people do admit you, and are summon'd
    To meet anon, upon your approbation.
  SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus.
  SICINIUS. You may, sir.
  SICINIUS. Fare you well.
                                  Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
    He has it now; and by his looks methinks
    'Tis warm at's heart.
  SICINIUS. How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
  SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.
  SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to see't,
    Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness  
    To yield your voices?
  SICINIUS. Thus to have said,
    As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
    And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
    Either his gracious promise, which you might,  
    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
    Which easily endures not article
    Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
    You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
    And pass'd him unelected.
  SICINIUS. Have you
    Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
    Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
    Your su'd-for tongues?
  SICINIUS. Let them assemble;
    And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
    Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
    And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
    With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
    How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
    Thinking upon his services, took from you
    Th' apprehension of his present portance,
    Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
    After the inveterate hate he bears you.
  SICINIUS. Say you chose him
    More after our commandment than as guided
    By your own true affections; and that your minds,
    Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
    Than what you should, made you against the grain
    To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
  SICINIUS. One thus descended,
    That hath beside well in his person wrought  
    To be set high in place, we did commend
    To your remembrances; but you have found,
    Scaling his present bearing with his past,
    That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
    Your sudden approbation.
  SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come.
    We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
    And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,  
    Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt
ACT III. SCENE I.
Rome. A street
Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS,
TITUS LARTIUS, and other SENATORS
  SICINIUS. Pass no further.
  SICINIUS. Stop,
    Or all will fall in broil.
  SICINIUS. You show too much of that
    For which the people stir; if you will pass
    To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
    Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
    Or never be so noble as a consul,
    Nor yoke with him for tribune.
  SICINIUS. 'Twere well
    We let the people know't.
  SICINIUS. It is a mind
    That shall remain a poison where it is,
    Not poison any further.
  SICINIUS. Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
    As traitors do.
  SICINIUS. This a consul? No.
  SICINIUS. Go call the people,  [Exit AEDILE]  in whose name myself  
    Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
    A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
    And follow to thine answer.
  SICINIUS. Help, ye citizens!
              Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES
  SICINIUS. Here's he that would take from you all your power.
  SICINIUS. Hear me, people; peace!
  SICINIUS. You are at point to lose your liberties.
    Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
    Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
  SICINIUS. What is the city but the people?
  SICINIUS. This deserves death.
  SICINIUS. Therefore lay hold of him;
    Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
    Into destruction cast him.
  SICINIUS. Where is this viper
    That would depopulate the city and
    Be every man himself?
  SICINIUS. He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
    With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,
    And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
    Than the severity of the public power,
    Which he so sets at nought.
  SICINIUS. Peace!
  SICINIUS. Sir, how comes't that you
    Have holp to make this rescue?
  SICINIUS. Consul! What consul?
  SICINIUS. Speak briefly, then,
    For we are peremptory to dispatch
    This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
    Were but one danger, and to keep him here
    Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
    He dies to-night.  
  SICINIUS. He's a disease that must be cut away.
  SICINIUS. This is clean kam.
  SICINIUS. The service of the foot,
    Being once gangren'd, is not then respected  
    For what before it was.
  SICINIUS. What do ye talk?
    Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
    Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!
  SICINIUS. Noble Menenius,
    Be you then as the people's officer.
    Masters, lay down your weapons.
  SICINIUS. Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there;
    Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
    In our first way.
  SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue
    Of all the voices that we have procur'd,
    Set down by th' poll?
  SICINIUS. Have you corrected them by tribes?
  SICINIUS. Assemble presently the people hither;
    And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
    I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either
    For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
    If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!'
    Insisting on the old prerogative
    And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.
  SICINIUS. Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,
    When we shall hap to give't them.
  SICINIUS. Well, here he comes.
  SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people.
  SICINIUS. I do demand,
    If you submit you to the people's voices,
    Allow their officers, and are content
    To suffer lawful censure for such faults
    As shall be prov'd upon you.
  SICINIUS. Answer to us.
  SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
    From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
    Yourself into a power tyrannical;
    For which you are a traitor to the people.
  SICINIUS. Mark you this, people?
  SICINIUS. Peace!
    We need not put new matter to his charge.
    What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
    Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
    Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
    Those whose great power must try him- even this,
    So criminal and in such capital kind,
    Deserves th' extremest death.
  SICINIUS. For that he has-
    As much as in him lies- from time to time
    Envied against the people, seeking means
    To pluck away their power; as now at last
    Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
    Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
    That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,
    And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
    Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,
    In peril of precipitation
    From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
    To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name,  
    I say it shall be so.
  SICINIUS. He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
  SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what?
  SICINIUS. Go see him out at gates, and follow him,  
    As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
    Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard
    Attend us through the city.
  SICINIUS. Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
    The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
    In his behalf.
  SICINIUS. Bid them home.
    Say their great enemy is gone, and they
    Stand in their ancient strength.
  SICINIUS. Let's not meet her.
  SICINIUS. They say she's mad.
  SICINIUS. Are you mankind?
  SICINIUS. O blessed heavens!
  SICINIUS. What then?
  SICINIUS. I would he had continued to his country
    As he began, and not unknit himself
    The noble knot he made.
  SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited
    With one that wants her wits?                Exeunt TRIBUNES
  SICINIUS. We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.
    His remedies are tame. The present peace
    And quietness of the people, which before
    Were in wild hurry, here do make his friends
    Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,
    Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
    Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see
    Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
    About their functions friendly.
                          Enter MENENIUS
  SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind
    Of late. Hail, sir!
  SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd  
    But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,
    And so would do, were he more angry at it.
  SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you?
  SICINIUS. God-den, our neighbours.
  SICINIUS. Live and thrive!
  SICINIUS. This is a happier and more comely time
    Than when these fellows ran about the streets
    Crying confusion.
  SICINIUS. And affecting one sole throne,
    Without assistance.
  SICINIUS. We should by this, to all our lamentation,
    If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
  SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius?
  SICINIUS. Tell not me.  
    I know this cannot be.
  SICINIUS. 'Tis this slave-
    Go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising,
    Nothing but his report.
  SICINIUS. What more fearful?
  SICINIUS. This is most likely!
  SICINIUS. The very trick on 't.
  SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
    These are a side that would be glad to have
    This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
    And show no sign of fear.
  SICINIUS. Nor I.
  SICINIUS. Pray let's go.                                Exeunt
SCENE VII.
A camp at a short distance from Rome
Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT
  SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
    In this so never-needed help, yet do not
    Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
    Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
    More than the instant army we can make,
    Might stop our countryman.
  SICINIUS. Pray you go to him.
  SICINIUS. Yet your good will
    Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
    As you intended well.
  SICINIUS. Not?
  SICINIUS. Why, what of that?
  SICINIUS. Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
    condition of a man?
  SICINIUS. He lov'd his mother dearly.
  SICINIUS. Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.
  SICINIUS. The gods be good unto us!
  SICINIUS. What's the news?
  SICINIUS. Friend,
    Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?
  SICINIUS. First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
    Accept my thankfulness.
  SICINIUS. They are near the city?
  SICINIUS. We'll meet them,
    And help the joy.                                     Exeunt
SCENE V.
Rome. A street near the gate
Enter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, passing over the stage,
'With other LORDS

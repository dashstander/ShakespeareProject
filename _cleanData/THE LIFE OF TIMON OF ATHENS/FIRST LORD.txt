  FIRST LORD. What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
  FIRST LORD. That time serves still.
  FIRST LORD. Hang thyself.
  FIRST LORD. He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in
    And taste Lord Timon's bounty? He outgoes
    The very heart of kindness.
  FIRST LORD. The noblest mind he carries
    That ever govern'd man.
  FIRST LORD. I'll keep you company.                      Exeunt
SCENE II.
A room of state in TIMON'S house
Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet serv'd in;
FLAVIUS and others attending; and then enter LORD TIMON, the states,
the ATHENIAN LORDS, VENTIDIUS, which TIMON redeem'd from prison.
Then comes, dropping after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself
  FIRST LORD. My lord, we always have confess'd it.
  FIRST LORD. Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
    would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of
    our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.
  FIRST LORD. You see, my lord, how ample y'are belov'd.
      Music. Re-enter CUPID, witb a Masque of LADIES as Amazons,
          with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing
  
  FIRST LORD. Where be our men?
  FIRST LORD. I am so far already in your gifts-
  FIRST LORD. We are so virtuously bound-
  FIRST LORD. The best of happiness, honour, and fortunes, keep with
    you, Lord Timon!
  FIRST LORD. The good time of day to you, sir.
  FIRST LORD. Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red.
    I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial
    of his several friends.
  FIRST LORD. I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting,
    which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath
    conjur'd me beyond them, and I must needs appear.
  FIRST LORD. I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
    things go.  
  FIRST LORD. A thousand pieces.
  FIRST LORD. What of you?
  FIRST LORD. Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
  FIRST LORD. I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that
    I return'd you an empty messenger.
  FIRST LORD. Royal cheer, I warrant you.
  FIRST LORD. How do you? What's the news?
  FIRST LORD. How? how?
  FIRST LORD. How now, my lords!
  FIRST LORD. He's but a mad lord, and nought but humours sways him.
    He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has beat it out of
    my hat. Did you see my jewel?
  FIRST LORD. Let's make no stay.

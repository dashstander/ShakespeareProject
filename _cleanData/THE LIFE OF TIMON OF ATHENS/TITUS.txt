    For which I wait for money.
  TITUS. One of Lord Timon's men.

    come forth?
  TITUS. We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.
  TITUS. Do you hear, sir?
  SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT. By your leave, sir.
  TITUS. We wait for certain money here, sir.
  TITUS. O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
  TITUS. We cannot take this for answer, sir.
  TITUS. My lord, here is my bill.
  LUCIUS' SERVANT. Here's mine.
  TITUS. Mine, fifty talents.

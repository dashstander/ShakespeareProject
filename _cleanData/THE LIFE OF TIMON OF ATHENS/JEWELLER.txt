  JEWELLER. Nay, that's most fix'd.
  JEWELLER. I have a jewel here-  
  JEWELLER. If he will touch the estimate. But for that-
  JEWELLER. And rich. Here is a water, look ye.
  JEWELLER. What, my lord! Dispraise?
  JEWELLER. My lord, 'tis rated
    As those which sell would give; but you well know
    Things of like value, differing in the owners,
    Are prized by their masters. Believe't, dear lord,
    You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
  JEWELLER. We'll bear, with your lordship.
  JEWELLER. You know me, Apemantus?

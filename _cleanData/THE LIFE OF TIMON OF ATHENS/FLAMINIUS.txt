  FLAMINIUS. As you have said, my lord.          Exeunt SERVANTS
  FLAMINIUS. I thank you, sir.
                           Enter LUCULLUS
  FLAMINIUS. His health is well, sir.
  FLAMINIUS. Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lord's  
    behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply;  who, having
    great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to
    your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present
    assistance therein.
  FLAMINIUS. Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
  FLAMINIUS. Is't possible the world should so much differ,

    And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
    Which my lord paid for be of any power
    To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!                Exit
SCENE II.
A public place
Enter Lucius, with three STRANGERS
  FLAMINIUS. No, indeed, he is not.
  FLAMINIUS. I need not tell him that; he knows you are to diligent.
 Exit  
                 Enter FLAVIUS, in a cloak, muffled
  LUCIUS' SERVANT. Ha! Is not that his steward muffled so?
    He goes away in a cloud. Call him, call him.
  FLAMINIUS. [Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
           Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following
  FLAMINIUS. My lord-

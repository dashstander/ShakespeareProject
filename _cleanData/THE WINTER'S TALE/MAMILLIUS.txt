  MAMILLIUS. Ay, my good lord.
  MAMILLIUS. Yes, if you will, my lord.
  MAMILLIUS. No, my lord, I'll fight.
  MAMILLIUS. I am like you, they say.
  MAMILLIUS. No, I'll none of you.
  MAMILLIUS. You'll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if
    I were a baby still. I love you better.
  MAMILLIUS. Not for because
    Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
    Become some women best; so that there be not
    Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
    Or a half-moon made with a pen.
  MAMILLIUS. I learn'd it out of women's faces. Pray now,
    What colour are your eyebrows?  
  MAMILLIUS. Nay, that's a mock. I have seen a lady's nose
    That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
  MAMILLIUS. Merry or sad shall't be?
  MAMILLIUS. A sad tale's best for winter. I have one
    Of sprites and goblins.
  MAMILLIUS. There was a man-
  MAMILLIUS. Dwelt by a churchyard- I will tell it softly;
    Yond crickets shall not hear it.

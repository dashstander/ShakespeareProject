  MOPSA. Now, in good time!
  MOPSA. I was promis'd them against the feast; but they come not too
    late now.
  MOPSA. He hath paid you all he promis'd you. May be he has paid you
    more, which will shame you to give him again.
  MOPSA. I have done. Come, you promis'd me a tawdry-lace, and a pair
    of sweet gloves.
  MOPSA. Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print a-life, for
    then we are sure they are true.
  MOPSA. Is it true, think you?
  MOPSA. Pray you now, buy it.
  MOPSA. Let's have some merry ones.
  MOPSA. can both sing it. If thou'lt bear a part, thou shalt hear;
    'tis in three parts.
  MOPSA.       O, whither?
  MOPSA.     It becomes thy oath full well
             Thou to me thy secrets tell.
  MOPSA.     Or thou goest to th' grange or mill.
  MOPSA.     Thou hast sworn it more to me.
             Then whither goest? Say, whither?

# ShakespeareProject

This is a project for Stat 133 by Lilian Gao and Dashiell Stander. We used a logistic regression model to classify Shakespeare characters' gender solely by their dialogue. A full write up can be found in the results folder.

Running the skeleton.R file will recreate the entire project and from that file you can see the flow of the code that we wrote.
